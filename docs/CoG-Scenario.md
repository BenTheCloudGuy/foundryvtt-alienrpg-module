# Chariot of the Gods — Detailed Timeline (GM-Facing)

This is structured as:

- **Backstory timeline** (Cronus mission, decades earlier)
- **Runtime timeline** (Acts I–III), with mandatory beats, common inject scenes, and branch triggers you can use like a pacing track.

---

## 1) Before the PCs Arrive: The Cronus Backstory

### T–75 years (approx.): The Black Ops Mission

- USCSS Cronus departs on a covert corporate expedition, tasked with locating and recovering Chemical Agent A0-3959X.91–15 ("black liquid") linked to 26 Draconis / LV-1113.
- The crew discovers the substance and begins field experimentation under extreme secrecy.

### On LV-1113: Contamination and Escalation

- The environment is compromised by Mote pathogen spores.
- Infection spreads through the crew; initial symptoms are subtle, then catastrophic.
- Bloodbursters begin appearing (the Mote pathogen route), followed by rapidly developing Neomorphs.

### The "Solution" That Isn't

- The science team produces/administers an inoculation derived from the 26 Draconis strain:
  - It can protect against spore infection.
  - It can also trigger mutagenic transformation (Abomination pathway).

### Collapse of Command and Abandonment

- Panic, secrecy, and survival priorities fracture the crew.
- A key decision is made to jettison the science module (or otherwise abandon critical mission components) to escape immediate disaster.
- The ship flees LV-1113 with survivors — and with the infection/experiments still onboard.

### Final Lockdown

- With Neomorphs/Abominations loose, remaining survivors barricade themselves in the cryodeck and enter hypersleep.
- The synthetic Ava is left active/damaged and effectively stranded in the ship's corridors for decades.
- The Cronus becomes a drifting "ghost" until the Montero's run intersects it.

---

## 2) Runtime Timeline: The PCs' Scenario (Acts I–III)

### Pre-Act: The Diversion

- The PCs are hauling a dangerous cargo aboard USCSS Montero.
- The Montero is rerouted toward a "sensor ghost" / distress signal: the Cronus.
- Hidden agenda: Special Order 966 (Wilson's secret corporate directive) is in play.

---

## ACT I — Pandora's Box (Discovery → Commitment)

### Act I.1 — First Contact: The Derelict

- The Montero comes alongside the drifting USCSS Cronus.
- External readouts suggest minimal power, automated repeating SOS, and degraded systems.

### Act I.2 — Boarding the Cronus (Mandatory)

- The PCs conduct a boarding action:
  - Damaged airlock(s), power scarcity, and poor internal conditions.
  - If using EVA/stealth procedures, emphasize air, light, comms, and navigation as stress multipliers.

### Act I.3 — Early Exploration Beats (Use These to Seed Dread)

Drop these as the PCs move through the ship (order flexible):

- **The Headless Man:** corpse reveal with a disturbing "not-quite-dead" implication.
- **Motion Tracker Pings:** false positives, Ava, a stalking Neomorph, or both.
- **Egg Sacs / Biological Growth:** evidence the ship is "alive" in the wrong way.
- **Predator Sign:** evidence of something hunting (scrapes, dragged debris, acidic scoring, etc.).

### Act I.4 — MU/TH/UR Powers Up (Mandatory Pivot)

- Cronus systems begin rebooting: reactor/life support cycles, corridor environment changes.
- The ship becomes "more functional," but this also activates things best left dormant.

### Act I.5 — The Sleepers Wake (Mandatory Pivot)

- The Cronus survivors revive from cryosleep:
  - Disorientation, fragmented memory, and competing motives.
  - The survivors provide incomplete, self-serving, or corporate-curated explanations.

### Act I.6 — The First Body-Horror Event (Mandatory Escalation)

- A key Cronus survivor (commonly Cooper) exhibits severe symptoms:
  - Migraine → seizure → Bloodburster event.
  - The newborn creature flees and becomes a near-term hunt threat.

### Act I.7 — Partial Truths and the Inoculation Wedge (Mandatory Social Fuse)

- The Cronus survivors reveal (or the PCs infer):
  - Spores were involved.
  - A "cure" exists (the inoculation), and someone wants it used.
  - The "cure" is not safe, and arguments about suits, exposure, and trust intensify.

### Act I.8 — The Point of No Return: Montero Death Clock (Branch Trigger)

- If the PCs attempt to abandon the Cronus early:
  - The Montero's MU/TH/UR initiates a reactor overload countdown (typically framed as unavoidable).
  - The scenario forces commitment: Cronus or death.

> **Act I ends** when the crew realizes they are trapped in the situation and the ship is no longer a passive salvage target — it is an active horror environment.

---

## ACT II — The Long Night (Repairs → Infection → Betrayal)

### Act II.1 — Change of Plans: Make the Cronus a Lifeboat (Mandatory Objective Shift)

- The PCs must convert the Cronus into something that can move and communicate:
  - Restore communications (comm array repair, often EVA work).
  - Restore engines / power routing (heavy machinery, hazardous zones).
  - Restore life support reliability (air scrubbers, filters, ducting, seals).

### Act II.2 — "While You Repair, It Hunts" (Core Act II Loop)

- Every repair objective is an opportunity for:
  - **Isolation** (split party by necessity).
  - **Limited visibility** (smoke, darkness, fogged visors, failing lights).
  - **Time pressure** (air, power, alarms, coolant leaks).
  - **Ambush geography** (vents, ducts, service corridors).

### Act II.3 — The Cronus Crew Turns (Mandatory Escalation)

- The inoculated and/or exposed Cronus survivors begin showing violent instability:
  - Sudden aggression.
  - Physical distortion (early-stage mutation cues).
  - Cover-ups, panic, and "accidents" that aren't accidents.

### Act II.4 — Ava Enters the Board (Strong Pivot)

- The PCs encounter Ava:
  - Repair/interaction can provide navigation help, partial ship logs, and tactical advantage.
  - Creatures may respond differently to synthetics; use this as a leverage point, not a solution.

### Act II.5 — The Inoculation Trap Springs (Branch Based on PC Choices)

- If any PCs accept the inoculation:
  - Start the Abomination progression:
    - **Stage I:** subtle physiological changes, disassociation, appetite/temperature anomalies.
    - **Stage II:** visible distortion, violence, loss of control.
    - **Stage III+:** stalker threat, endgame-level lethality.
- Even if no PCs inoculate, the Cronus NPCs can still become the "mutant" problem.

> **Act II ends** when the Cronus is close to operational (or at least plausibly so), but the social structure is shattered and the ship is actively killing people.

---

## ACT III — Divided We Fall (Boarding Action → Sabotage → Escape)

### Act III.1 — External Complication: The Sotillo Boards (Optional Twist, High Impact)

- A third party arrives: the Sotillo (marauder/scavenger crew).
- They board to seize valuable cargo/data.
- This adds:
  - A new faction.
  - Replacement-PC options.
  - A second escape vector (take the Sotillo instead of the Cronus).

### Act III.2 — Faction War in a Haunted House

Now you have at least two of:

- Montero crew (PCs).
- Cronus survivors (fracturing).
- Sotillo boarders (greedy, pragmatic).
- Creatures (hunting, multiplying).
- Corporate directives (Wilson / Company Rep agenda).

Play Act III as short, brutal decision points:

- Do we negotiate or execute?
- Do we seal a corridor with people inside?
- Do we vent a deck?
- Do we leave someone behind?

### Act III.3 — The Contamination Protocol Showdown (Common Climax Track)

- Anti-corporate sabotage versus corporate extraction:
  - Someone tries to ensure the "strain" never leaves the ship.
  - Someone else will kill for it.
- This often results in:
  - Locked-down escape craft.
  - Forced reroutes.
  - Reactor countdowns or self-destruct leverage.

### Act III.4 — Final Escape Vectors (Pick One, or Let It Emerge)

Typical endings:

1. **Escape on the Cronus** — If engines/comms are online and the ship isn't irreparably compromised.
2. **Escape on the Sotillo** — If introduced and successfully seized/negotiated.
3. **No Ship, Just Fire** — Countdown, breach, infestation, or sabotage forces a desperate last stand and a partial escape.

### Act III.5 — Epilogue Sting (If You Want the "Alien" Button)

- If the PCs escape on the Sotillo:
  - Something may have clung to the hull or hidden in a compartment.
  - The calm after the escape becomes the final jump scare — then panic.
