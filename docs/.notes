Language: Nodejs

Objectives:
- NEVER COMMIT or PUSH CHANGES TO GIT/GITHUB..
- Any time you are writing directions or documentation do not use LLM Emojis or formating. Keep it clean, simple, and human sounding. 
- Create an old style green screen interactive terminal style interface for use with FoundryVTT AlienRPG game. 
- It must support displaying digital maps.. 
- It must be branded to look like it is part of weyland-yutani ships computer interface
- It will have interactive buttons on either side for navigating the computer system
- It will support touch screen
- The frame/image in the middle should support pinch zoom and and scrolling independent of navigation buttons -- example in image.png ![alt text](image.png)
- There must be a way to allow underlying Foundry Scenes to be display in the display frame
- TERMINAL requires opening muthurGPT in the display frame - source code for mutherGPT found in /mutherGPT directory.
- It needs to plug into AlienRGP for FoundryVTT found - game system found in /alienrpg directory
- This will be used as interactive aid for my players when running Chariots of the Gods AlienRGP TTRPG
- It will update the Status of the ship via Status Logs (JSON FILES) that muthurGPT can reference when users asks about ship status.
