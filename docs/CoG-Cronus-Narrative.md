# PART ONE: ORIGINS

## 1.1 The Ship

The USCSS Cronus, Registration 142601, was a Weyland SEV M3 Heliades-Class Science Exploration Vehicle -- one of the most advanced deep-space research platforms ever constructed by the Weyland Corporation. At 130 meters long, 48.75 meters wide, and 36.5 meters tall, she was a cathedral of human ambition wrapped in reinforced hull plating and powered by four nuclear-powered ion plasma engines.

She had four decks. Deck A housed the cryogenic chambers and the MU/TH/UR 2000 Mainframe -- the ship's artificial intelligence. Deck B was the main operational level: bridge, crew quarters, mess hall, med lab, armory, two science laboratories, and a corporate suite that most of the crew quietly resented. Deck C held cargo bays, coolant tanks, the reactor relay and control systems, and an external elevator airlock. Deck D was the vehicle bay -- home to four ATV NV6 runabouts, two RT Series Group Transports, and two heavy mineral extractors.

The Cronus was a variant of her class. On standard Heliades ships, the Class D module served as a lifeboat. On the Cronus, it had been redesigned as a classified, specially-equipped science laboratory that could be jettisoned in case of emergency. This modification was not in the general crew briefing materials.

Her armory carried six Weyland Storm Rifles, six M4A3 Service Pistols, and two Armat Model 37A2 12-gauge pump-action shotguns. For a science vessel, she was well-armed. Nobody asked why.

## 1.2 The Crew

Thirty souls were assigned to the Cronus. Twenty-nine humans and one Weyland synthetic designated Ava.

### Command

**Captain Helena Russo, 45** -- A veteran of deep-space exploration with two decades of Weyland service. Russo had commanded three prior survey missions, all successful, all profitable. She ran her ship with quiet authority and genuine care for her crew. She was the kind of captain who remembered birthdays and knew every crewmember's name. The crew loved her for it. The company valued her because she delivered results without asking uncomfortable questions.

**First Officer Liam Chen, 38** -- Russo's right hand. Efficient, meticulous, and reserved. Chen handled the administrative machinery that kept the Cronus running smoothly. He was respected more than liked -- the kind of officer who made sure the duty roster was fair but who you wouldn't invite for a drink afterward.

**Second Officer Albert Johns, 47** -- A career company man who had never quite found the ambition to push for a command of his own. Johns was competent but deferential, always looking for someone to follow rather than lead. He kept his head down and did his job. This submissive quality would later save his life, and doom others.

**Navigation Officer Erik Muller, 36** -- Quiet and precise. Muller plotted courses with a surgeon's care and spent most of his off-hours running simulations. He had transferred from a commercial hauler and considered the Cronus assignment the high point of his career.

### Science Department

The Cronus carried an unusually large science team -- nine specialists, reflecting the true priority of the mission.

**Chief Scientist Daniel Cooper, 53** -- Brilliant, rational, and haunted by a conscience that would ultimately put him at odds with his corporate masters. Cooper had spent thirty years in xenobiology research. He understood the implications of what they were being sent to find better than anyone aboard, and the weight of that knowledge sat heavily on his angular frame. He was the kind of scientist who still believed research should serve humanity, not quarterly earnings reports.

**Xenobiologist Marco Fischer, 37** -- Fischer was Cooper's protege and closest confidant in the department. Energetic and curious to a fault, he had a habit of getting too close to specimens. Cooper had written him up twice for breach of containment protocol. Fischer always apologized, always meant it, and always did it again.

**Xenoarcheologist Elias Ritter, 29** -- The youngest member of the science team. Ritter was on his first deep-space assignment and treated the entire mission with the breathless enthusiasm of someone who hadn't yet learned to be afraid. He was brilliant with ancient structures and alien artifacts. He would be the first casualty on LV-1113.

**Exogeologist Amina Hussain, 41** -- Grounded and methodical. Hussain studied the bones of worlds -- their geological history, mineral composition, tectonic patterns. She was also the closest thing the science team had to a voice of caution. When things started going wrong on LV-1113, she was one of the first to argue for immediate departure.

**Astrochemist Yuna Kim, 32** -- Precise and particular about her work. Kim analyzed atmospheric and chemical compositions. Her initial readings of LV-1113's atmosphere would prove prescient -- she flagged several anomalous compounds in her first report that no one took seriously enough.

**Biochemist Samira Alavi, 30** -- Alavi worked closely with Cooper on pathogen analysis. When the biological samples came in from LV-1113, she was the first to note the mutagenic properties of the substance later designated Chemical Agent A0-3959X.91-15. Her lab notes, if they had survived the data purge, would have been the most valuable documents aboard.

**Organic Chemist Avery Johnson, 41** -- Johnson handled the molecular analysis side of the bio lab. A quiet, steady presence in the lab who preferred to let his work speak for itself.

**Data Analyst Tara Singh, 45** -- Singh compiled, organized, and archived the mountain of data the science team generated. She maintained the research databases and handled data transmission protocols. Her meticulous indexing made Lori Clayton's later data theft both easier and more complete.

**Cultural Anthropologist Linh Nguyen, 34** -- An unusual addition to a scientific survey team. Nguyen's presence suggested that someone at Weyland expected to find evidence of intelligent life on LV-1113. They were right.

### Engineering

**Chief Engineer Alexei Ivanov, 48** -- A bear of a man who spoke to the Cronus's engines the way another man might speak to a horse. Ivanov had kept older ships than this running on nothing but spare parts and profanity. He carried a deep, genuine love for the ship, and treated every hull plate and pipe junction as if it were a living thing under his care.

**Mechanical Engineer Zoe Martinez, 35** -- Ivanov's most trusted subordinate. Martinez could diagnose a mechanical fault by sound alone. She was famous aboard the Cronus for once repairing the secondary coolant pump with a piece of cafeteria cutlery.

**Electrical Engineer Miles O'Connor, 34** -- Handled the Cronus's power distribution, lighting systems, and electrical grid. O'Connor was meticulous, kept detailed maintenance logs, and had a morbid sense of humor that got darker the deeper they got into space.

**Propulsion Engineer Connor Smith, 29** -- The youngest of the engineering team. Smith maintained the four ion plasma engines and worked closely with Ivanov on FTL drive operations. He had a promising career ahead of him.

### Medical

**Chief Medical Officer Isaac Tremblay, 50** -- Twenty-six years of starship medical service had given Tremblay an unshakeable calm and a comprehensive knowledge of every way the human body could fail in deep space. He ran the med lab with two Pauling Medpods and the kind of quiet competence that made people feel safe.

**Ship Medic Liam Flynn, 27** -- The youngest officer aboard. Flynn had signed on for the hazard pay and the adventure. He got both. Beneath a nervous, fearful exterior was a surprisingly capable field medic who functioned well under pressure -- as long as he didn't have time to think about what he was doing. His survival instinct was pathological. He would lie, cheat, and abandon others to stay alive, and he knew this about himself, and it ate at him.

**Psychologist Noah Schwartz, 37** -- Assigned to monitor crew mental health during the extended mission. Schwartz kept detailed psychological profiles on every crewmember. His notes on the crew's deteriorating morale in the final days on LV-1113 would have made disturbing reading.

### Security

**Security Chief Valerie Reid, 34** -- Former colonial marine. Hard as the hull plating and twice as unyielding. Reid treated the crew's safety as her personal mission with an intensity that bordered on obsession. She ran weapons drills that the science team complained about and the command staff only tolerated because Russo insisted. She was direct, occasionally brutal, and absolutely the person you wanted between you and something trying to kill you. She would earn her shotgun a hundred times over on LV-1113.

**Security Officer Don Jackson, 42** -- Jackson had been doing private security for Weyland for fifteen years. Steady and reliable, he was Reid's second and handled the routine security work that kept the ship safe during the long transit.

**Armorer Sven Eriksson, 37** -- Maintained the armory and all weapons systems. Eriksson was quiet, efficient, and kept the weapons in perfect working order. He also maintained an unofficial weapons log that tracked every round issued and returned.

### Support

**Communications Officer Kenji Watanabe, 36** -- Handled all ship-to-ground and ship-to-corporate communications. Watanabe was also responsible for maintaining the long-range comms array and encryption protocols.

**Corporate Liaison Lori Clayton, 42** -- And here was the knife in the dark. Clayton's official role was to represent Weyland Corporation's interests aboard the Cronus, manage corporate assets, and ensure contractual compliance. Her actual role was something far more dangerous. Ruthless, calculating, and utterly loyal to the company's bottom line, Clayton had a secondary directive that superseded every life aboard the ship. She carried company override codes that gave her backdoor access to the MU/TH/UR mainframe -- codes that could override navigation, delete research data, and redirect the ship itself. Nobody but Clayton and Weyland's Special Projects Division knew about these codes. Her agenda was simple: bring back the specimens and the medic Flynn -- who had unknowingly been exposed to something the company wanted badly -- at any cost. Any cost at all.

**Quartermaster Grace O'Malley, 41** -- Managed supplies, provisions, and logistics. O'Malley ran the supply chain with an iron fist and tracked every calorie and spare part aboard. She was also the crew's unofficial problem-solver -- need something, ask Grace.

**Cargo Supervisor Jasper Thomson, 45** -- Oversaw the cargo bays on Deck C. Thomson handled the heavy equipment, mineral extractors, and the loading procedures for scientific samples.

**Navigation Officer Irina Sokolov, 29** -- Secondary nav officer who assisted Muller and handled plotting during off-shifts.

**Culinary Specialist Anne Chen, 35** -- The crew's cook. On a ship where morale could make or break a mission lasting months, Chen's role was more important than most people realized. She turned reconstituted protein and hydroponic vegetables into meals that almost tasted like home. The mess hall was her kingdom, and she ruled it well.

**Ava, Synthetic** -- Weyland Corporation Model 6 artificial person. Ava appeared to be in her twenties, with a helpful and cooperative demeanor that was either programmed or genuine -- even Ava might not have known which. She was the most physically capable entity aboard the Cronus and carried a deep directive to protect the human crew, even at cost to herself. She never slept, never ate, and never complained. During the 120-day outbound transit while the crew was in hypersleep, Ava maintained the ship alone, checked every system, secured every piece of cargo, and waited patiently for the humans to wake up.

## 1.3 The Mission

### What the Crew Was Told

They were told it was a scientific survey. The 26 Draconis system, 45.3 light-years from Earth, contained a trinary star system with a planetary debris belt. A small planetoid designated LV-1113 had returned anomalous readings from long-range probes. The Cronus would travel to 26 Draconis, survey LV-1113, catalog any biological and geological specimens of interest, and return. Standard deep-space survey work. Routine. Lucrative bonuses for all participants.

### What the Crew Was Not Told

Special Order 966.

Transmitted under NOEROMO Protocol to Science Officer Johns -- not Cooper, notably, but Johns, a command officer who could be more easily leveraged -- the order was unambiguous:

> CRONUS MISSION. PRIORITY ONE. OBTAIN AND ANALYZE CHEMICAL AGENT A0-3959X.91-15. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS SECONDARY. CREW IS EXPENDABLE.

Authorization: SPD-Director Meridian, Weyland-Yutani Special Projects Division.

Somewhere in the Weyland Corporation's labyrinthine intelligence network, data had surfaced suggesting that LV-1113 harbored a substance of extraordinary mutagenic potency. Chemical Agent A0-3959X.91-15 -- referred to internally as "the black liquid" or "the accelerant" -- had been previously deployed on LV-1113 by an unknown agency, resulting in catastrophic mutations of the planetoid's native lifeforms. Weyland wanted it. Weyland wanted it badly enough to send thirty people to get it and classify them all as expendable.

Johns received the order. Johns said nothing.

Clayton carried the override codes. Clayton said nothing.

The Cronus departed Earth on March 28, 2110, with 29 humans and one synthetic. None of them -- save two -- knew they were already dead.

---

# PART TWO: THE VOYAGE OUT

## 2.1 Departure

**March 28, 2110 -- 07:04 UST**

Navigation lock confirmed: 26 Draconis. Estimated transit time: 120.7 days.

Authorization was received from Luthor Colony Control at 07:39, and by 08:10, all 29 human crewmembers had been placed into hypersleep. The displacement drive engaged twelve minutes later, and the Cronus began her long fall toward the 26 Draconis system.

Ava remained awake.

For 120 days, the synthetic moved through the empty corridors of the Cronus like a ghost, checking systems, adjusting course corrections, securing cargo that shifted during acceleration phases, and running diagnostic after diagnostic. She reported all cargo secure within the first day. The remaining 119 were spent in the particular solitude that only a synthetic can endure -- alone but not lonely, purposeful but without urgency.

The ship hummed. The stars moved. The crew dreamed their chemical dreams in the cryo chambers, and the universe outside was vast, silent, and indifferent.

---

## 2.2 Arrival

**July 26, 2110 -- 16:10 UST**

The Cronus arrived in the 26 Draconis system and achieved orbit around 26 Draconis B. At 22:53, all 29 human passengers were successfully revived from hypersleep. The process took just over an hour, followed by the standard post-cryo assessment period -- nausea, muscle stiffness, disorientation. Normal. Expected. By the next morning, everyone was functional.

Captain Russo held a full crew briefing at 06:00 the following day. The mission parameters were reviewed. The science team was restless with anticipation. Even Cooper, who kept his cards closer than most, allowed himself a rare smile.

---

# PART THREE: LV-1113

## 3.1 First Light

**July 27, 2110**

At 09:32, Captain Russo made her first log entry from orbit:

> "Unusual ecosystem detected on the planetoid LV-1113. Strangely lush for such a small rock."

She was right to be surprised. LV-1113 was a small planetoid -- barely enough mass to hold a meaningful atmosphere. It sat in the planetary debris belt shared by the three suns of the 26 Draconis trinary system, bathed in shifting, overlapping light from its three parent stars. Its atmosphere was nitrogen-heavy (72%) with significant carbon dioxide (18%), methane (6%), and trace gases (4%). Surface temperatures ranged from -42 degrees C to -18 degrees C. Gravity was 0.86G -- lighter than Earth, enough to notice in your step.

None of this should have supported the kind of vegetation the sensors were showing. LV-1113 was carpeted in organic growth that had no business being there. Dense, alien flora covering a world that should have been barren rock. Something had accelerated the biology of this place far beyond what its environment could naturally sustain.

Kim flagged anomalous chemical signatures in the upper atmosphere during her first pass. Electromagnetic interference in the upper atmosphere degraded long-range sensor accuracy below 200 kilometers altitude. Hussain noted the geological strata were inconsistent -- surface formations that were too young for the underlying bedrock by millions of years.

Nobody listened carefully enough.

At 12:46, Russo authorized breaking orbit and initiated landing procedures. The Cronus descended through the EM-heavy atmosphere and touched down at coordinates 11:34:45S / 140:11:03E at 18:07. Textbook landing.

By 19:48, the science module had been deployed -- the classified jettison-capable laboratory that rode the Cronus's belly -- and the vehicle bays were unsealed. ATVs rolled out onto alien soil. The crew's boots made the first human footprints on LV-1113.

The air smelled wrong. Not toxic, the rebreathers confirmed that, but wrong -- a chemical sweetness underneath the expected cold, like overripe fruit frozen and thawed and frozen again. Nguyen would later describe it in her personal journal as "the smell of something dreaming."

---

## 3.2 The Survey

**July 27 -- July 30, 2110**

The first three days on LV-1113 were, by every official metric, a triumphant success.

The science team fanned out from the landing site in ATV convoys, cataloging flora, collecting soil and atmospheric samples, and mapping the local terrain. The vegetation was extraordinary -- bioluminescent in some cases, reactive to touch in others. Fischer was in his element, collecting specimen after specimen, his containment protocols growing sloppier as his excitement grew. Cooper noticed. Cooper always noticed.

By July 30, the science team had uploaded 19 ecological reports. Russo logged the milestone with evident satisfaction:

> "The science team uploaded 19 reports related to ecological readings and specimens. They sure seem happy."

They were happy. They were also standing on the back of something that was about to wake up.

### Personal Journal -- Dr. Amina Hussain, Exogeologist (July 29)

> The geological surveys continue to confound. The surface stratigraphy tells two completely different stories. Below 200 meters, standard silicate formations consistent with a planetoid of this mass and age. Above that line -- chaos. Mineral deposits that shouldn't exist here. Crystal structures with organic inclusions. And the soil... the soil is alive in ways I can't explain with standard geochemistry. It's as if something was poured over this world -- something that rewrote the rules. I've flagged it in my report. Cooper nodded and said he'd look into it. I don't think he was surprised.

### Personal Journal -- Xenobiologist Marco Fischer (July 29)

> Incredible day. Specimen 14 is unlike anything in the catalog. A plant-analogue with a vascular system that responds to proximity. Not touch -- proximity. It knows you're there before you reach it. The biochemistry is going to keep Alavi busy for months. Ritter is practically vibrating -- says he found carved stone fragments near the northern ridge. Carved. On a planetoid. I told him it's probably natural fracturing. He gave me that look. Kid's going to be insufferable if he's right.

---

## 3.3 The Ruins

**July 31, 2110**

He was right.

At 10:57, Russo logged:

> "A ruin was found at coordinates 11:32:54S / 139:40:18E, and the advanced science team departed to examine."

The ruins were approximately 30 kilometers from the landing site -- a cluster of structures partially buried beneath millennia of accumulated growth. They were unmistakably artificial. Massive stone blocks, precisely cut, arranged in geometric patterns that Nguyen immediately recognized as architectural rather than geological. The construction material was a dark, almost black stone that didn't match any local geology. It had been brought here, or fabricated here, by something with intelligence and purpose.

Ritter was the first inside. His helmet-cam footage -- later partially recovered before Clayton's data purge -- showed a descending passage, smooth-walled, leading to a vaulted chamber roughly fifteen meters in diameter. The walls were covered in raised relief carvings depicting biological forms in various stages of transformation. At the center of the chamber sat a low platform holding several sealed containers, dark and conical, coated in a thin film of condensation despite the sub-zero surface temperature.

The containers held a black, viscous liquid.

Chemical Agent A0-3959X.91-15. The 26 Draconis Strain.

Cooper knew what it was the moment the spectral analysis came back. Or more precisely, he knew what it did. The accelerant -- the mutagenic pathogen that had rewritten LV-1113's entire biosphere from barren rock to alien jungle. The substance that had turned ordinary microbial life into the sprawling, reactive, almost sentient-seeming ecosystem they had been cataloging for three days.

Johns knew too. He had his orders.

### Personal Journal -- Linh Nguyen, Cultural Anthropologist (July 31)

> I have spent my career studying the remnants of civilizations through their art, their tools, their architecture. I have never stood in a place like this. The carvings are not decorative. They are instructional. A manual, carved in stone by hands -- or appendages -- that understood biology at a level we cannot yet comprehend. The relief panels show a sequence: application of a substance to biological matter, followed by progressive transformation. Growth. Change. Mutation. And at the end of the sequence, something new. Something that was neither the original organism nor anything recognizable. The Engineers -- I am calling them that, for lack of a better term -- the Engineers did not discover evolution. They deployed it. They aimed it. They used it as a tool. And then they left. I don't know why. I'm not sure I want to.

---

## 3.4 The Bio Lab

**August 1, 2110**

At 13:55, Cooper logged:

> "The bio lab on the Cronus was engaged to perform studies of the samples, and artifacts retrieved from the dig. Synthetic unit logged all samples stored in quarantine properly."

Ava helped catalog everything. Every sample, every artifact, every sealed container -- logged, tagged, and placed in quarantine storage aboard the Cronus. Ava was thorough. Ava was always thorough.

The science module -- the classified jettison-capable laboratory deployed on the surface -- was running full-spectrum analysis on the atmospheric and soil samples. Aboard the Cronus, Cooper and Alavi worked on the biological specimens in Science Lab 1. Fischer continued his xenobiological surveys in the field.

The black liquid was stored separately, in a dedicated containment unit within the bio lab. Cooper's lab notes from this period are fragmentary -- most were destroyed in Clayton's later data purge -- but what survives suggests he understood the danger almost immediately.

The samples were alive. Not alive in the way bacteria are alive -- alive in a way that defied classification. The liquid exhibited motility, chemical reactivity to nearby organic material, and what Cooper described in one surviving scrawled note as "purposeful molecular reorganization." It wasn't just mutagenic. It was transformative on a cellular level, rewriting DNA like an editor revising a draft. And it was fast.

### Surviving Lab Note Fragment -- Dr. Daniel Cooper (August 1)

> A0-3959X.91-15 contact experiment -- Specimen 7 (local flora, root structure). Applied 0.2 mL via micropipette to exposed cambium. Immediate absorption. Within 4 minutes, cellular restructuring visible at 200x magnification. The specimen is not dying. It is becoming something else. Growth rate has accelerated by a factor I cannot yet calculate. New tissue differentiation occurring -- structures with no analog in the original organism. Terminating experiment. Sample sealed in Level 4 containment. Note to self: this is the most dangerous substance I have ever handled. Whatever was done to this world was done deliberately, and whoever did it understood exactly what they were creating.

---

## 3.5 First Blood

**August 1, 2110 -- 23:18 UST**

Elias Ritter was admitted to the med lab.

The official log entry read "native animal attack." The reality was worse. Ritter had been working late at the ruin site with a small security escort when something emerged from the undergrowth -- fast, pale, and built for killing. A creature unlike anything in the ecological surveys. Where the cataloged fauna of LV-1113 were strange but passive, this thing was a predator of terrifying efficiency. It moved on four limbs but could rear up on two. Its skin was translucent, showing moving shadows of organs beneath. It had no visible eyes.

It hit Ritter before anyone could react. Jackson got off two shots that drove it back into the dark, but the damage was done. Ritter had deep lacerations across his torso and a puncture wound in his left shoulder. Flynn patched him in the field, and they got him back to the Cronus.

At 23:22, Cooper requested quarantine measures for Ritter.

Chief Medical Officer Tremblay and Flynn stabilized Ritter in the med lab. The wounds were cleaned, sutured, and dressed. Ritter was sedated and placed in one of the Pauling Medpods for monitoring. Tremblay noted in his assessment that the wound margins were unusual -- the tissue showed localized cellular changes inconsistent with simple laceration. He flagged it for Cooper's attention.

Cooper came to the med lab at 01:00. He examined the wound margins under magnification. He said nothing for a long time. Then he ordered a full isolation protocol for Ritter and requested that no one else enter the med lab without protective equipment.

Schwartz, the psychologist, noted in his files that Cooper's demeanor changed fundamentally after this examination. The enthusiasm was gone. What remained was a man carrying the weight of knowledge he wished he didn't have.

### Personal Journal -- CMO Isaac Tremblay (August 1, late)

> Ritter is stable but I don't like what I'm seeing. The wound margins aren't healing normally -- or rather, they're healing too well. New tissue is forming faster than it should, and the cellular morphology is... not right. Cooper has ordered full isolation and he won't explain why. I've been doing this for 26 years and I know what a man looks like when he's scared. Cooper is scared. I'm starting to think I should be too.

---

## 3.6 Escalation

**August 2, 2110 -- 04:26 to 11:02 UST**

Things moved fast.

At 04:26, Captain Russo initiated prelaunch procedures. Something had convinced her -- Cooper's quarantine request, Tremblay's medical observations, or her own instinct -- that it was time to leave. She also authorized armory access for Corporal Reid at 06:46, noting:

> "Reports of additional native species attacks at the Science Module. Giving access to ship's armory to CPL REID, V."

Multiple creatures had been sighted near the deployed science module. The predators -- later classified as Neomorphs, organisms born from the Mote pathogen spores that permeated LV-1113's ecosystem -- were converging on the human presence. The science team at the surface module was being recalled.

Reid drew weapons from the armory and distributed them to her security team. Jackson and Eriksson armed up. Reid herself took her preferred weapon -- an Armat Model 37A2 shotgun that she had kept in immaculate condition throughout the voyage. She also issued M4A3 service pistols to members of the science team still in the field.

The field teams began pulling back to the Cronus. Some made it. Some did not.

What happened at the science module between 06:46 and 11:02 is reconstructed from fragmentary radio communications and the evidence of the aftermath. The creatures attacked in numbers. They were fast, they were silent until they struck, and they came from multiple directions. The science module's perimeter was breached. People were killed -- quickly, violently, and without warning.

In the chaos, the surface teams closest to the Cronus were recalled aboard. Those at the science module were cut off.

### Reconstructed Radio Transcript Fragment (August 2, ~09:30)

> **MARTINEZ:** Cronus, this is Martinez at the module, we have contact-- multiple contacts on the south perimeter, do you copy?
>
> **WATANABE:** Copy, Martinez. Security is en route to your position--
>
> **MARTINEZ:** No! No, no, tell them to turn back, there's something in the treeline, it's-- [STATIC] --oh God, Hussain is down, she's down, it came right through the wall--
>
> **WATANABE:** Martinez, say again, you're breaking up--
>
> **JACKSON:** [radio overlap] Watanabe, this is Jackson, we are pinned at the north ridge, two creatures in the open, we cannot reach the module, repeat, we cannot reach the module--
>
> **MARTINEZ:** [screaming in background] --they're inside! They're inside the module! Ivanov, seal the-- [PROLONGED STATIC]

---

## 3.7 Emergency Launch

**August 2, 2110 -- 11:02 UST**

At 11:02:32, Second Officer Albert Johns initiated emergency launch procedures using Emergency Override Keycard 1.

The Cronus screamed skyward on pillars of nuclear fire, abandoning the science module, the ATVs, and everyone who hadn't made it back aboard. Johns had activated the jettison sequence for the science module before launch -- it separated from the ship and remained on the surface. Whatever samples, specimens, and research were still inside it were left behind on LV-1113's surface.

Johns logged:

> "Oh God they're all dead. It was so fast. Captain Russo and the others oh god. We had no choice."

Captain Helena Russo was dead. First Officer Liam Chen was dead. Of the 30-soul crew, only 14 humans and the synthetic Ava made it off the planet.

The dead and missing:

- **Captain Helena Russo** -- killed during the evacuation. Circumstances unclear. Her loss shattered the command structure.
- **First Officer Liam Chen** -- killed alongside Russo.
- **Navigation Officer Erik Muller** -- failed to reach the ship.
- **Xenobiologist Marco Fischer** -- at the science module when it was overrun.
- **Exogeologist Amina Hussain** -- confirmed killed at the science module.
- **Astrochemist Yuna Kim** -- failed to reach the ship.
- **Biochemist Samira Alavi** -- failed to reach the ship.
- **Organic Chemist Avery Johnson** -- failed to reach the ship.
- **Data Analyst Tara Singh** -- failed to reach the ship.
- **Cultural Anthropologist Linh Nguyen** -- killed near the ruins.
- **Chief Engineer Alexei Ivanov** -- last heard on radio from the science module.
- **Mechanical Engineer Zoe Martinez** -- last heard on radio from the science module.
- **Electrical Engineer Miles O'Connor** -- failed to reach the ship.
- **Propulsion Engineer Connor Smith** -- failed to reach the ship.
- **Chief Medical Officer Isaac Tremblay** -- killed during the evacuation.
- **Security Officer Don Jackson** -- last heard pinned at the north ridge.

Fourteen humans survived the launch: Johns, Reid, Flynn, Cooper, Clayton, Schwartz, Eriksson, Watanabe, O'Malley, Thomson, Sokolov, Anne Chen, Moore, and Ritter (still quarantined in med lab). Plus Ava.

The Cronus achieved orbit of LV-1113 at 11:44.

---

# PART FOUR: THE LONG FALL

## 4.1 Taking Stock

**August 2, 2110 -- 12:05 UST**

Johns made his second log entry from the bridge, still shaking:

> "This is Second Officer Johns, in command, I guess. Survivors cleared by Dr Cooper. Everyone is pretty shaken. I ordered Moore to plot a course to the nearest station. We lost half our people down there, and there are just 14 of us left. Plus Ava of course. Once Cooper and Flynn secure the specimens, and we get D-Deck secured, we should be ready to get into hypersleep and go to FTL. God what a nightmare."

The survivors were in shock. Schwartz, the psychologist, circulated among them doing what he could, but what do you say to people who just watched their friends get torn apart by things that shouldn't exist?

Cooper and Flynn worked to secure the specimens that had been brought aboard from the bio lab. Some samples of the 26 Draconis Strain were still in containment aboard the Cronus -- not all of it had been in the surface module. Cooper wanted it destroyed. He understood now what it could do to a human body, what it was already doing to Ritter in the med lab.

But there were other priorities. D-Deck -- the vehicle bay -- needed to be secured. The hatches that had been open for ATV deployment during the surface operations had been sealed during the emergency launch, but no one had done a thorough sweep. In the chaos of the evacuation, no one could be certain that nothing had come aboard with them.

### Medical Report -- Dr. Daniel Cooper, Acting CMO (August 2, 12:30)

> Post-evacuation medical assessment, USCSS Cronus. 14 surviving crew examined. Minor injuries treated: lacerations (3), contusions (2), mild hypoxia from exertion (4). One crew member -- Ritter, E. -- remains in quarantine in Medpod 1. His condition is deteriorating in ways I cannot explain within normal medical parameters. Cellular changes are accelerating. I have sedated him and recommend he remain in isolation. I have assumed CMO duties following the death of Dr. Tremblay. God help us all.

## 4.2 The Betrayal

**August 2, 2110 -- 12:56 UST**

Fifty-one minutes after Johns made his log entry ordering a course to the nearest station, something happened that would seal the fate of everyone aboard the Cronus.

At 12:56:36, a Company Override Code was entered on Console B7:

> Override all navigational destination data, replace with POL-6387. Expiration: None.

At 12:56:58:

> Transfer RESEARCH\LV1113\*.* to B7\MCD.

At 12:58:20:

> Delete RESEARCH\LV1113\*.*

Lori Clayton.

While the crew grieved and trembled, while Cooper tended to the dying and Flynn stitched wounds with shaking hands, while Reid armed herself and swept the corridors and Johns tried desperately to hold together a command structure that had already shattered -- Clayton walked to Console B7 in the corporate suite, entered her codes, and did three things.

She redirected the Cronus's navigation from the nearest station to POL-6387 -- a Weyland Corporation deep-space outpost. She transferred every piece of research data from the LV-1113 mission to a portable media device. And then she deleted every copy from the ship's computers.

Seventy-five years of ecological surveys, xenobiological analyses, geological data, atmospheric readings, the cultural artifacts, Nguyen's translations, Cooper's pathology reports, Kim's chemical analyses, all 19 published expedition reports, and every piece of evidence about what they had found on LV-1113 -- gone. Wiped from every server and backup on the Cronus in a single recursive deletion.

Clayton pocketed the drive, returned to the common areas, and said nothing. Her mission was simple and unchanged: bring Flynn and a sample of the 26 Draconis Strain back to Weyland-Yutani. Collect her paycheck. No matter who you need to kill to get there.

Moore, who had been ordered to plot a course to the nearest station, received the new navigation lock at 15:48:35 -- destination GL537A: Delos Colony, ETA 9.6 days. One second later, Clayton's override redirected it: destination POL-6387, ETA 74.8 days.

Moore must have seen the override. Whether he understood what it meant, we'll never know.

## 4.3 Hell Below Decks

**August 2, 2110 -- 15:32 to 18:05 UST**

Something had come aboard.

At 15:32:07, the MU/TH/UR mainframe logged the first warning:

> WARNING: Unidentified lifeforms detected on D Deck.

Plural. Lifeforms. On the vehicle bay deck, where the hatches had been open to the surface of LV-1113 during field operations. Something had gotten inside. Maybe during the evacuation rush, maybe earlier. Maybe it had been growing in the dark while the crew was on the planet, nesting in the vehicle bay's equipment sheds and parts storage, feeding on whatever it could find.

What happened next played out over two and a half hours, logged in cold, clinical system alerts:

- **15:49** -- Weapons fire on D Deck.
- **15:51** -- Unidentified lifeform detected on C Deck. It was moving up.
- **15:56** -- Explosion in Elevator 2.
- **15:59** -- Weapons fire on C Deck.
- **16:01** -- Weapons fire on B Deck. It had reached the main deck.
- **16:07** -- Explosion in Science Lab 2. Fire in Science Lab 2.
- **16:14** -- Unidentified lifeform detected on B Deck.
- **16:52** -- Log entry MOORE, J: "Mother you fucking fuck fuck [inaudible]"
- **16:53** -- Explosion on the bridge.
- **16:56** -- Hypersleep vault door sealed on order of CPL Reid, V.
- **17:15** -- Bridge damage detected. Manual controls disabled.
- **17:18** -- Weapons fire on C Deck.
- **17:25** -- Seven humans successfully placed in hypersleep.
- **17:28** -- Displacement drive engaged.
- **18:05** -- Weapons fire in armory.
- **18:05** -- Connection lost with synthetic unit.
- **20:10** -- Airlock D-4 cycled.

Two and a half hours. That's how long it took for the Cronus to go from a shaken but functional ship to a charnel house.

The creatures -- Neomorphs born from the Mote pathogen that permeated LV-1113's ecosystem, or perhaps something worse that had gestated from infected crew -- tore through the ship deck by deck. The crew fought. Reid fought hardest of all, her shotgun thundering in corridors never designed for combat, fighting a retreating action that bought the others time. Eriksson opened the armory and distributed weapons. Watanabe tried to raise help on the comms. Cooper and Flynn worked to seal the specimens.

But the creatures were faster, stronger, and more numerous than anyone expected. Elevator 2 was destroyed -- probably deliberately, to deny the things a path upward, or perhaps in the crossfire. Science Lab 2 detonated -- possibly an accident during weapons fire, possibly Eriksson or someone else making a choice about what the creatures might find in there. The bridge was hit. Moore's panicked, profane log entry was the last thing anyone on the bridge said before it went dark.

Reid made the call. She ordered everyone who could still move to the cryo deck on Deck A and sealed the hypersleep vault. Seven people made it inside.

Seven. Out of fourteen survivors. Half their remaining number, gone in two hours.

The seven who entered the cryo chambers:
- Albert Johns
- Valerie Reid
- Liam Flynn
- Daniel Cooper
- Lori Clayton
- And two others -- assigned to pods 9 and 11 -- whose names were not recorded in the surviving log data.

At 17:28, with the vault sealed and the seven sleepers locked in their frozen coffins, the displacement drive engaged. The Cronus had enough automation to do that much. The ship lurched into faster-than-light travel, bound for POL-6387 on Clayton's ghost course.

Outside the vault, the killing continued. Weapons fire in the armory at 18:05. Then, simultaneously, connection was lost with Ava.

The synthetic had been fighting. Somewhere in the corridors of Decks B, C, or D, Ava had been fighting to protect the crew, fulfilling her core directive without regard to her own safety. The loss of connection could mean damage, destruction, or simply that the ship's internal communication network had been compromised. Ava's fate is unknown.

At 20:10, Airlock D-4 cycled. Someone -- or something -- opened an exterior airlock on D Deck. Was it a final desperate act? An attempt to vent the creatures into space? Or did one of the creatures figure out how to open a door?

The ship's internal sensors went silent after that. Whatever remained alive aboard the Cronus -- human, synthetic, or otherwise -- left no further record.

### Reconstructed Personal Account -- CPL Valerie Reid (fragmentary, from auto-recording device recovered from cryo deck)

> I'm putting this on record because somebody should know what happened. If you're listening to this, we're probably dead.
>
> They came up through D Deck. At least three of them, maybe more. Fast -- faster than anything that size should be. O'Malley and Thomson didn't make it past the cargo bay. Eriksson and I laid down suppressing fire on the C Deck catwalk while the others fell back. Eriksson was hit -- one of those things got in close, opened him up. He kept shooting. He kept shooting until he couldn't anymore.
>
> The bridge is gone. Something detonated up there -- not sure what. Moore, Watanabe, Sokolov, Chen -- they were up there. I don't know if any of them made it out.
>
> I sealed the vault. Cooper, Flynn, Clayton, Johns, and two others. Seven of us. I'm the last one in. I can hear them outside. Scratching.
>
> If you find this ship, don't open anything. Don't take anything. Burn it. Burn it all.

## 4.4 The Escape Pods

At some point between the departure from LV-1113 and the micrometeorite storm two months later, every Class A escape pod on the Cronus was jettisoned.

The cryo team didn't do it -- they were in hypersleep. The creatures couldn't have operated the pod controls. That leaves the surviving crew who didn't make it to the cryo vault, or Ava.

The most likely explanation: some of the surviving crew outside the vault attempted to escape the ship using the pods after Reid sealed the hypersleep chamber. Whether they made it, whether the pods functioned, whether anyone was alive inside them when they launched -- all unknown. The pods carried no FTL capability and limited life support. Launched in deep space between star systems, they would have been coffins.

It's also possible that Ava jettisoned the pods to prevent the creatures from escaping the ship by any means. That would be consistent with her directive to protect human life -- not the humans aboard, perhaps, but humanity as a whole.

---

# PART FIVE: ADRIFT

## 5.1 The Meteorite Storm

**October 12, 2110 -- 20:45 UST**

Seventy-one days after leaving LV-1113, the Cronus's automated systems detected objects on a collision trajectory. Analysis identified a micrometeorite field. Emergency course change was initiated, and the displacement drive was disengaged.

It wasn't enough.

The storm hit the Cronus like the fist of God. Hull damage in multiple locations. The communications array was destroyed. The main power coupling failed. Engine Pods 1 through 4 went offline in rapid succession -- all four engines dead in under a minute. The reactor, sensing catastrophic power spikes across multiple systems, initiated an emergency shutdown.

In the cryo vault, two people died.

- **20:54:20** -- Cardiac arrest detected in Hypersleep Pod 11.
- **20:55:44** -- Cardiac arrest detected in Hypersleep Pod 9.

The occupants of those pods -- their names unrecorded -- were killed when the power fluctuations disrupted their cryogenic support systems. They never woke up. They simply stopped, their biological processes arrested not by the careful chemical sleep of hypersleep but by the sudden, violent failure of the machines keeping them alive.

Five remained. Johns. Reid. Flynn. Cooper. Clayton. Dreaming in their frozen capsules, unaware that the ship had just become their tomb.

At 21:16, the MU/TH/UR mainframe assessed the situation:

> Ship trajectory is off course, unable to correct. Location identified in deep space between Alpha Aurigae and Lambda Aurigae at coordinates (24.3, 39.2), with a .25c rimward vector.

Dead in space. No engines, no comms, no navigation. Drifting at a quarter of lightspeed on a course to nowhere, lost in the void between Alpha Aurigae and Lambda Aurigae.

At 21:22:55, MU/TH/UR initiated a general distress signal on frequency 8713.41 -- the universal emergency channel. The signal would repeat endlessly, beaming outward into a universe that had better things to listen to.

---

## 5.2 The Long Sleep

**April 12, 2111**

Six months after the meteorite storm, with no rescue and no response to the distress signal, the Cronus's dwindling power reserves triggered the final safeguard. Powersaving mode initiated. Life support shut down. The interior temperature plunged to -18.7 degrees Celsius. Emergency lighting only. The CO2 scrubbers, already degraded, dropped to 0.02% effectiveness. The air quality began its slow, decades-long deterioration -- carbon dioxide building to 25,500 ppm, unsafe but not immediately fatal.

One week later, on April 19, 2111, MU/TH/UR initiated core shutdown.

The last functioning intelligence aboard the Cronus went dark. The mainframe's final entry was its own death notice.

And then there was silence.

---

## 5.3 The Void

The Cronus drifted.

For 75 years, the ship barreled through interstellar space at sublight speed, a 130-meter coffin of frozen steel carrying five dreamers and whatever else had survived the carnage. The distress signal pulsed outward. The emergency lights flickered in the permanent dark. The air grew stale and toxic. Ice formed on every surface -- walls, consoles, the glass faces of the cryo pods.

The CO2 scrubber filters, due for replacement on a regular maintenance cycle, passed their service date. Then passed it again. And again. By the time anyone would find the ship, the filters would be overdue by 72 years, 9 months, and 14 days.

The ship's artificial gravity continued to function -- the system was robust enough to survive what the engines and comms couldn't. The reactor, shut down to emergency reserves, maintained just enough power to keep the cryo pods running at minimal capacity. The five sleepers persisted in biological stasis, their metabolic processes slowed to nearly nothing, their bodies aging minutes while the universe aged decades.

Elevator 2 remained destroyed. The bridge remained damaged. Science Lab 2 remained a fire-scarred ruin. The airlock on Deck C malfunctioned. The airlocks on Deck D were inoperable. The escape pod vestibules on Deck B stood empty, every pod long gone.

Somewhere in the dark corridors of the Cronus, whatever had been left behind continued to exist. Whether the creatures survived, adapted, hibernated, or died is unknown. Whether Ava -- damaged, disconnected, but perhaps not destroyed -- continued to move through the frozen hallways is unknown. The ship kept no log of it. There was no one left to observe, and no machine left running to record.

The stars turned. The ship drifted. The signal pulsed.

Nobody came.

# PART SIX: RESURRECTION

## 6.1 Found

**March 9, 2185**

75 years, 5 months, and 7 days after MU/TH/UR went offline, the mainframe received a restart command.

> 2185-03-09 {12:52:22} Initiating MU/TH/UR Core system restart.

Someone had found the Cronus.

The USCSS Montero -- a commercial hauler under contract to the merged Weyland-Yutani Corporation -- had intercepted the ancient distress signal while on a routine cargo run. Diverted to investigate, the Montero's crew found what appeared to be a derelict: a Heliades-class vessel, decades old, running on emergency power, coated in micrometeorite scoring and interstellar ice.

The Montero's crew:
- **Captain Vanessa Miller, 46** -- Thrifty and practical. Her concern was her crew and her ship, in that order.
- **Pilot Leah Davis, 27** -- Skilled, reckless, and hungry for something more exciting than cargo runs.
- **Corporate Liaison John J. Wilson, 43** -- Ambitious. Carrying his own corporate directives. Another company knife, another set of secret orders.
- **Technician Kayla Rye, 23** -- Bitter, capable, and tougher than she looked.
- **Cargo Handler Lyron Cham, 32** -- Loyal to his crew. Strong. The kind of man who puts himself between danger and the people he cares about.

They came alongside the Cronus. They restored power to the mainframe. They boarded.

And just like that, the story began again.

The five sleepers in their frozen pods -- Johns, Reid, Flynn, Cooper, Clayton -- waited in their chemical dreams. The old ship groaned and ticked as power flowed through circuits that hadn't carried current in three-quarters of a century. The emergency lights brightened slightly. The MU/TH/UR mainframe ran its boot sequence, restoring systems, accessing logs, tallying damage.

The ship remembered everything. Every log entry, every alert, every death. It remembered Russo's optimism and Moore's terror. It remembered the weapons fire and the explosions and the screaming. It remembered Clayton's override codes and the data that had been stolen and destroyed. It remembered the signal it had been sending into the void for 75 years.

And now, finally, someone had answered.

---

## 6.2 What They Will Find

The boarding party will find a ship in deep freeze. Interior temperature: -18.7 degrees Celsius. Emergency lighting only. The air is breathable but dangerous -- 25,500 ppm CO2, enough to cause headaches, dizziness, and impaired judgment. Air scrubbers at 0.02% effectiveness. Filters 72 years overdue.

They will find a ship that tells a story in its damage. Elevator 2, destroyed. Science Lab 2, fire-scarred. The bridge, explosion-damaged with manual controls disabled. Blast shutters on the bridge viewports sealed tight. Acid scoring on walls and floors in corridors that once saw combat against things that bled acid. Weapons fire pockmarks. Barricades hastily assembled and then breached.

They will find the armory, still stocked with whatever weapons weren't expended in the fighting. The manifest says six Weyland Storm Rifles, six M4A3 Service Pistols, two shotguns. What remains to be found may be less.

They will find five people in cryogenic sleep. Alive. Biometrics within normal parameters. Waiting to be woken up. Five people who survived something terrible and who each carry a piece of the truth -- but none of them carry all of it, and some of them are lying.

They will find no escape pods. They will find no science module. They will find a navigation system locked to a destination -- POL-6387 -- that none of the surviving crew will admit to setting.

And somewhere in the dark, in the frozen corridors and sealed compartments and damaged decks of a ship that has been dying for 75 years, they may find that they are not alone.

The signal has been answered.

The Cronus is waiting.

## A.3 -- Captain Russo's Personal Journal (Found in Captain's Quarters, Deck B)

```
PERSONAL -- RUSSO, H.

MARCH 28, 2110
Another mission, another goodbye to nobody in particular.
Thirty souls under my command. Good people, mostly. Cooper's
science team is the best I've worked with -- they're excited
about this one. Even Clayton seems less corporate than usual,
which probably means she's better at hiding it.

Johns worries me a little. Good officer, but he waits. Always
waits for someone to tell him what to do. I need him to step
up if anything goes sideways. Talked to him about it over
coffee. He nodded. He agreed. I don't think he heard a word.

120 days to 26 Draconis. Into the pod I go.

JULY 27, 2110
We're down. LV-1113 is extraordinary. The vegetation alone --
this planetoid shouldn't support any of this. Cooper and
Fischer are like kids in a toyshop. Even Hussain is smiling,
and she doesn't smile at anything less than a tectonic
anomaly.

Something about this place, though. Can't put my finger on
it. The ecosystem is too much. Too lush, too responsive, too
alive for a rock this size in a trinary debris belt. It's
like somebody planted a garden here.

Kim flagged some atmospheric compounds. I'll follow up with
Cooper tomorrow.

JULY 31, 2110
Ritter found ruins. Actual ruins -- constructed, artificial,
deliberate. On a planetoid 45 light-years from Earth. I've
sent the advanced team to investigate. This could be the
discovery of the century. Of any century.

Cooper didn't look happy when I told him. That's unusual.

AUGUST 1, 2110
Ritter is in medical. Animal attack -- something from the
local fauna that we haven't cataloged. Nasty wounds. Cooper
has him quarantined and won't explain why a man with
lacerations needs quarantine.

I'm ordering prelaunch. My gut says we've been here long
enough. When the chief scientist starts keeping secrets, it's
time to leave.

AUGUST 2, 2110 -- 06:30
More attacks at the science module. I've given Reid access to
the armory. Pulling everyone back to the ship. We leave today.

```
FIELD NOTES -- RITTER, E. -- XENOARCHEOLOGY
LV-1113 SURVEY, MISSION 721/A

JULY 27
First surface EVA. Deployed with Fischer and Nguyen to survey
sector 4-north. Vegetation is remarkable -- bioluminescent
species, reactive root networks, some kind of distributed
signaling mechanism through the ground cover. Ecological
readings off the charts.

Found carved stone fragments at the northern ridge, 8km from
landing site. Definitely artificial -- tool marks, geometric
cuts, internal crystalline structure inconsistent with
natural fracture patterns. Fischer says I'm seeing things.
Nguyen says I'm not.

JULY 31
I was right. Coordinates 11:32:54S / 139:40:18E. A ruin
complex. Partially buried, extensive, and unmistakably the
work of intelligent beings. The stone is imported -- not local
geology. Black, dense, almost warm to the touch despite the
surface temperature.

Found a descending passage. Smooth walls, vaulted ceiling.
Interior chamber approximately 15m diameter. Wall carvings
everywhere -- biological forms in transformation sequences.
Application, mutation, growth. Whatever built this place
understood biology the way we understand mathematics. As a
tool. As a language.

Central platform. Sealed containers. Dark, conical. Condensation
on the surface -- they're maintaining an internal temperature
differential in sub-zero conditions. These containers are
still active.

I want to open one. Cooper says no. Cooper says no to everything.

AUGUST 1
Cooper let us open one. Under full containment. The substance
inside is a black liquid, viscous, with an iridescent surface
sheen. Spectral analysis confirms organic molecular chains of
extraordinary complexity. It responds to proximity of organic
material -- the surface tension changes, the liquid orients
itself. It wants to make contact.

This is the most remarkable

## A.7 -- Noah Schwartz's Psychological Assessment (Found on Datapad in Crew Quarters, Deck B)

```
CONFIDENTIAL -- PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES
DR. N. SCHWARTZ, PhD -- SHIP PSYCHOLOGIST
USCSS CRONUS

PERIODIC ASSESSMENT -- MISSION WEEK 18 (AUGUST 1, 2110)

SUMMARY: Crew morale shows significant deterioration
following the discovery of ruins on LV-1113 and the injury
to RITTER, E. Stress indicators are elevated across all
departments.

INDIVIDUALS OF NOTE:

COOPER, D. -- Marked behavioral change over past 48 hours.
Previously engaged and collaborative. Now withdrawn,
evasive in conversation, and exhibiting signs of acute
anxiety. Suspect he knows more about the nature of LV-1113
discoveries than he is sharing. Recommend command-level
debrief.

JOHNS, A. -- Elevated stress. Avoidant decision-making.
Continues to defer to Russo on all matters. Appears
overwhelmed by the escalating situation. Concern re:
command capability if chain of command is disrupted.

CLAYTON, L. -- No visible stress response. This is itself
notable. In a situation where every other crewmember shows
some degree of anxiety, Clayton's composure suggests
either exceptional coping mechanisms or foreknowledge that
reduces her uncertainty. I do not know which. I do not
like either option.

REID, V. -- Hypervigilant. Stress levels are high but
channeled productively into security operations. Reid
functions well under pressure. However, her recent
requests for expanded weapons distribution suggest she
is preparing for a scenario significantly worse than what
has been officially reported.

FLYNN, L. -- Acute anxiety. Compensating with dark humor
and avoidance. Performing medical duties competently
despite elevated fear response. Monitor for panic behavior
if situation worsens.

RITTER, E. -- In medical quarantine. Unable to assess
directly. Cooper has restricted access.

GENERAL RECOMMENDATION: Immediate departure from LV-1113.
Crew psychological state will not sustain extended surface
operations in current threat environment.

# APPENDIX C: THE THIRD PARTY -- USCSS SOTILLO

When the Cronus is discovered, other parties may take interest. The Sotillo -- a smaller vessel with a crew of opportunists and scavengers -- may arrive to seize what they believe is valuable salvage.

**Captain Adisa Bolaji, 30** -- Resolute and profit-driven. Bolaji sees the Cronus as a payday, not a graveyard. He'll try to turn the situation to his advantage without risking his ship or crew -- but his definition of acceptable risk is flexible when money is involved.

**Mechanic Micky Horton** -- Young, clever, and carrying an M240 Incinerator Unit that's almost as big as they are. Horton's priority is getting their Sotillo crewmates out alive. Everything else is secondary.

**Hired Muscle Pinion, 31** -- Steadfast and dangerous. Pinion is Bolaji's bodyguard and enforcer. Where Bolaji goes, Pinion goes, and anyone who threatens Bolaji will have to go through Pinion first. Carries an Armat M41A Pulse Rifle.

**Pilot Helen Bein, 53** -- Cynical, experienced, and perpetually in search of a drink. Bein has seen enough of space to know that derelict ships are never as empty as they look. She'll fly the Sotillo, and she'll do it well, but she'd rather be anywhere else. Carries a .357 Magnum revolver that she's had longer than most of her crew has been alive.

The Sotillo represents a wildcard -- a second escape vector, a rival faction, and replacement characters for players who lose their originals to the Cronus's many dangers.

# APPENDIX D: NARRATIVE THEMES AND GM NOTES

## The Five Sleepers -- Who They Really Are

Each of the five Cronus survivors carries a secret, an agenda, and a version of the truth that serves their survival. When they wake up (disoriented, amnesiac from 75 years of cryo, frightened), they will each push the story in a different direction.

**Albert Johns** -- The reluctant commander. Johns never wanted to be in charge, and the weight of what happened on his watch has broken something inside him. He'll look for someone -- anyone -- to follow. He'll help them, support them, and do whatever they say. But he knows about Special Order 966, and that knowledge is a poison he's been carrying since before the mission launched. He won't volunteer it. He will not lead.

**Valerie Reid** -- The soldier. Reid has one mode: eliminate threats. She fought the creatures on the ship and she will fight whatever she finds when she wakes up. She is direct, uncompromising, and completely willing to die to protect the remaining crew. Her loyalty is to people, not institutions. If she discovers the corporate betrayal, she will be furious. If she discovers there are creatures still aboard, she will say "I told you so" and reach for her shotgun.

**Liam Flynn** -- The survivor. Flynn is terrified. He was terrified before the cryo and he'll be terrified after. But he's also the medic, and people need him, and that's the only thing keeping him functional. His survival instinct is his defining trait -- he will lie, manipulate, and abandon others if he believes it will keep him alive. He doesn't want to be this way. He is anyway.

**Daniel Cooper** -- The conscience. Cooper understands what they found on LV-1113, what it can do, and what it will do if it reaches civilized space. His agenda is clear: the 26 Draconis Strain must never leave this ship. He will argue for containment, quarantine, and if necessary, destruction of the Cronus itself. He's rational, he's right, and he's going to make very few friends with what he has to say.

**Lori Clayton** -- The corporate knife. Clayton is the most dangerous person aboard, and she knows it. She has override codes, corporate authorization, and a mission that supersedes every life on the ship: bring back Flynn (who was exposed to the pathogen and is now a living specimen) and a sample of the 26 Draconis Strain. She will manipulate, deceive, and kill to accomplish this. She is calm, she is professional, and she has no conscience that the company hasn't purchased.

## The Ship as Character

The Cronus itself is the sixth character. A dying ship that remembers everything -- every joy, every horror, every betrayal. Its logs tell the story in fragments. Its damage tells it in scars. The frozen corridors, the acid-scored walls, the empty escape pod vestibules, the sealed hypersleep vault with its scratched door -- every room is a crime scene, every corridor is a grave.

Players who search the ship piece together the story murder-mystery style, one handout at a time. The picture that emerges is of a mission that was doomed from the moment Weyland wrote "CREW IS EXPENDABLE" on a corporate order.

## The Monsters in the Dark

Whatever came aboard from LV-1113 -- Neomorphs, Mote-infected crew, or something that gestated in the 75-year dark -- may still be here. The ship has been a sealed ecosystem for three-quarters of a century. Cold, dark, frozen -- but sealed. Life finds a way, especially life that was engineered to adapt, transform, and survive.

The creatures may be dormant. They may be dead. They may be breeding in D Deck where no one has gone in 75 years. The answer is whatever serves the horror.
