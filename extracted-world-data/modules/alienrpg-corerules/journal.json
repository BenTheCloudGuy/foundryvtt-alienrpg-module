that would become the UPP claimed the star systems nearest to Earth.\n        The American nations instead looked beyond the Outer Veil to conquer new rich and fertile territories.\n        Many of the worlds American explorers discovered on the Outer Rim were capable of supporting life without the use of Atmospheric Processors, making colonization swift and comparatively inexpensive.\n        The American colonies joined together and the United Americas were formed.\n        Fearing American expansion, the fledgling UPP poured its resources into exploring and claiming a large section of the Outer Rim as well—in the process over-extending themselves and crippling their economy.\n        While the 3WE has made its own limited push into the Outer Rim, it relies solely on Weyland-Yutani to handle such expansion efforts.\n        While civilized to some degree, the Outer Rim Territories of today are both bountiful and full of conflict.\n        Home to many military installations, the Outer Rim is where modern man fights his wars and faces the unknown.\n    </p>\n\n    <br /><br />\n    <h2 class=\"heading\">BORODINO SECTOR</h2>\n    <p>\n        Nestled in a pocket between the encroaching United Americas and the Union of Progressive Peoples, part of the Borodino Sector is openly disputed Frontier on the Outer Rim.\n        Here, a UPP system might be next-door neighbor to a UA one, and as such it is a volatile area.\n        It is the site of some of the Colonial Marines’ most famous battles, including the Tientsin Campaign and the Arcturan Conflicts.\n        Some worlds here have even declared their complete independence, while others are protected by the ICSC\n    </p>\n    <br /><br />\n    <h2 class=\"heading\">REQUIST SYSTEM</h2>\n\n    <table

served time there) is home to over 20,000 convicts.\n                    As the prison allows visitors, processing centers had to be built to accommodate them.\n                    Eventually, several visiting families decided to settle there, transforming the processing center into its own corporate run colony.\n                    Settlements developed in radiating lines from the massive prison facility and collectively became known as “the Sprawl.” <br />\n\n                    Taking advantage of its natural resources, the Seegson Corporation built several factories in the Sprawl to mass-produce gyrocars.\n                    As Weyland Corp developed better technologies, the Seegson models became less popular.\n                    The factories closed, the colony became destitute and the future prospects for those living there grew increasingly bleak.\n                    Taking advantage of the situation, the Colonial Marine Corps opened their largest recruitment center in the Outer Rim on DP-27.\n                    The USCMC offers colonists the chance to see the galaxy, making soldiers the planet’s major export.\n                </td>\n                <td

          "content": "<div class=\"alienrpg\">\n    <p>\n        The ALIEN roleplaying game is a horror game at its heart.\n        The question is not if but rather when the PCs will encounter something horrific and fight desperately to escape, or give their lives so that others might do so.\n        Fear and horror is in the very DNA of ALIEN. Your primary tools for invoking terror around the gaming table are stress and panic (see <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.1Kq2sfNcA1nwA7eX\" data-id=\"1Kq2sfNcA1nwA7eX\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">STRESS &amp; PANIC</a>).\n        Stress can be introduced by you as a GM when the PCs encounter certain horrific situations or fearsome beings, but it will mainly be incurred by the PCs in response to their own actions.\n        This makes your job easier. You just need to introduce a terror of some kind and then let the PCs interact with it while their Stress Levels ratchet up and their Personal Agendas collide.\n        In the end, the fight to survive will be as much against their own human nature as it will beagainst the horrific creature or situation they face.\n        Here are three tools to use for creating horror:\n        <br /><br />\n        <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN:</strong> Not knowing what you are facing is scary.\n        Use this to your advantage and let the enemies hide in the shadows for as long as possible.\n        Let the players’ imaginations do the work for you.\n        <br /><br />\n        <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">LOSS OF CONTROL:</strong> Make the PCs feel powerless by taking away their resources.\n        Turn off the lights. Cut the power. Make machinery malfunction.\n        When they lose control over things, fear takes over.\n        <br /><br />\n        <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">HORRIBLE CHOICES:</strong> Put them in situations where they have to make difficult, life-or-death choices.\n        Will they sacrifice one to save the many? Will they risk everything for a buddy? Make them decide.\n    </p>\n    <br /><br />\n\n    <h2 class=\"heading\">THE THREE STAGES OF FEAR</h2>\n    <p>\n        Creating horror in a roleplaying game is not always easy. Overdo it, and the players aren't scared anymore—downplay it, and the game drags on.\n        The key to Game Mothering horror is to manage pacing properly and keep the major threat hidden as long as possible.\n        To do this effectively, you need to carefully manage the stages of fear in the game: dread, terror, and horror.\n        <br /><br />\n        <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">DREAD:</strong> The sense that something bad is about to happen, but no-one is really sure what or why.\n        Dread is the first stage of fear in the ALIEN roleplaying game and should be employed as often as possible.\n        The key to using dread is planting seeds and watching events unfold.\n        The players know something terrible is about to take place, but without knowing what it is, they can't do anything about it.\n        This dread may evolve to the next stage, but sometimes it won't—and that's fine.\n        <br />\n        Examples of dread:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n        <li>A control panel indicates that the airlock was just cycled manually whilst all of the crew are accounted for on the bridge.</li>\n        <li>Someone finds blood on the walkway. The ship’s cat is missing.</li>\n        <li>A strange and leathery egg is found in a crashed derelict ship. It’s like something is alive in there. </li>\n    </ul>\n    <br />\n    <p>\n        <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">TERROR:</strong> You feel terror when you know something bad will happen any moment now.\n        It is no longer a question of if but rather when it will take place.\n        From a roleplaying perspective, the feeling of terror is the most effective feeling of fear as the PCs are at their most helpless state.\n        Therefore, terror often involves the scariest moments in a gaming session.\n        Use it selectively for maximum effect.\n        <br />\n        Examples of terror:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n        <li>A squad of marines investigating an old mine steps into something slimy. One of the marines hears a hissing sound. She realizes that something is directly above her.</li>\n        <li>A colonial marshal following a killer in the deep bowels of a space station realizes that she is the prey.</li>\n        <li>A pilot on a stranded shuttle barricaded in the cockpit hears pounding on the access hatch. Something wants in.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <br />\n    <p>\n        <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">HORROR:</strong> The ultimate form of fear is horror. Horror is the moment when the danger reveals itself.\n        It is the moment of climax.\n        The payoff that the earlier stages of fear have hinted at.\n        But because of this, it is also less scary than terror.\n        When horror hits, the game mechanics take over.\n        You draw initiative and fight it or try to escape.\n        Horror is vital to the game, but it should be used rarely and is often best utilized late in a game session rather than early.\n        <br />\n        Examples of horror:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n        <li>A corporate agent turns around and stands face to face with an alien baring its teeth.</li>\n        <li>The egg opens and a crab-like creature lunges at the closest crew member, attaching itself to her face amidst the screams of her friends.</li>\n        <li>Black, lightning-quick creatures crawl through the walls and roof towards the marine squad. </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <br />\n    <h2 class=\"heading\">RELIEVING STRESS</h2>\n    <p>\n        An important part of the game is managing the <b>STRESS LEVELS</b> of the PCs.\n        The players have several ways to do this, such as interacting with a signature item, finding a safe place to hide, or helping each other to calm down (see <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.1Kq2sfNcA1nwA7eX\" data-id=\"1Kq2sfNcA1nwA7eX\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">STRESS &amp; PANIC</a>).\n        As the GM, let them catch their collective breath and regroup from time to time.\n        Calmer periods are vital to keeping an atmosphere of horror throughout a game session.\n        This also opens up new opportunities for you to ramp up the pressure.\n        Once they feel safe and lower their guard, strike at them again. <br /><br />\n        After all, it’s not over until it’s over.\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <h2 class=\"heading\">SPLITTING THE TEAM</h2>\n    <p>\n        Sometimes the players will want to split up into smaller groups.\n        Let them. When doing this, it is important that you cut back and forth between the groups so that one group does not have to wait too long for the other.\n        Let them all stay at the table even if they are not in the same location.\n        Trust the players to separate what they know and what their PCs know.\n        Use the fact that they have split up to create interesting and scary situations.\n        Also, consider what means of communication the PCs have access to.\n        Do they have personal communicators? If not, are there communication terminals around?\n\n    </p>\n    <br /><br />\n    <table class=\"ntable\">\n        <caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n            <b>AGENDAS, SECRETS &amp; PVP</b>\n        </caption>\n        <tbody>\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n                    Every PC’s Personal Agenda is secret and only known to the player and the GM.\n                    Sometimes a player may want to secretly communicate something to you. We recommend that you let them, but keep it simple.\n                    Stay in the room and ask them to write something on a note.\n                    Some groups are comfortable with talking about secrets openly, separating their knowledge from that of their PCs.\n                    Find a way that makes sense to your group.\n                    Don’t overcomplicate things.\n                    And remember — if a PC starts to act in direct opposition to the rest of the group, it’s time to call PvP.\n                    Play the current scene to an end, and then turn the PC into an NPC.\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n</div>",

there?\n        This chapter provides the tools to help a GM develop a framework for creating a campaign as well as colony worlds and other adventure destinations.\n        It also provides random tables that are bursting with ideas for missions, complications, encounters and so on, whether you are Space Truckers, Colonial Marines or Frontier Colonists.\n        <br />\n        Bear in mind that random rolls are an aid to imagination and that GMs can always simply pick an entry from one of the tables if it looks suitable, or it holds some promise—don’t be a slave to the dice.\n        Often a set of random rolls will throw up interesting and unusual ideas for scenarios or locations that you may never have thought of otherwise, but always remember that results can be changed or ignored.\n    </p>\n    <br /><br />\n    <table class=\"ntable\">\n        <tbody>\n            <tr class=\"tr2\">\n                <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n                <td class=\"tcol2\">\n                    Before you set out to play a full campaign in the ALIEN roleplaying game, you need to decide which campaign framework to play— who the characters are and what role they have in the ALIEN universe.\n                    This is something we recommend that you do together with the players, as you will have more fun if everyone is involved in creating the game.\n                    <br />\n                    Three suggested campaign frameworks—Space Truckers, Colonial Marines, and Frontier Colonists—are described below, and later in this chapter you’ll find mission generators for each of them. <br />\n                    In the future, Free League Publishing will release a series of campaign modules that delve deeper into each of the three frameworks above, but the information in this chapter is enough to get you started on a full campaign in the ALIEN roleplaying game.\n                </td>\n                <td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n                <td

Remember to keep the squad small. <br />\n                    This is a roleplaying game, after all, not a wargame.\n\n                    <br /><br />\n                    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">TYPICAL JOBS:</strong> Military missions <br /> (see <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.qljqTQwzeeOjstz8.JournalEntryPage.xaBLDRB4dwUAhBs2\" data-id=\"xaBLDRB4dwUAhBs2\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">JOB GENERATOR</a>).\n                    <br /><br />\n                    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SUGGESTED EMPLOYERS:</strong> USCMC (United Americas), Space Operating Forces (Union of Progressive Peoples), Royal Marines Commandos (Three World Empire)\n                    <br /><br />\n                    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SUGGESTED CAREERS:</strong> Colonial Marine, Medic, Officer, Pilot, Roughneck.\n                    <br /><br />\n                    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SUGGESTED SPACESHIP:</strong> Conestoga-Class Frigate <br /> (see <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.axjrZpX0ieeF1Acf\" data-id=\"axjrZpX0ieeF1Acf\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">SPACESHIPS OF 2183 AD</a>).\n                    <br /><br />\n                    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">WEEKLY SALARY:</strong> $500–760\n\n                    <br /><br />\n                    <table class=\"ntable\">\n                        <caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n                            <b>CHAIN OF COMMAND</b>\n                        </caption>\n                        <tbody>\n                            <tr>\n                                <td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n                                    As marines, regardless of whether you work for the UA, 3WE or the UPP, you are part of a military organization and are expected to follow orders.\n                                    This means that you don’t get to choose which missions you are sent on, someone higher up simply gives you orders.\n                                    In game terms this means that the GM prepares a mission and gives the players a briefing on the objectives.\n                                    If you want a more open approach we recommend that you play as a mercenary company instead.\n                                    This way, you are free to choose where to go and which missions you want to take on.\n                                </td>\n                            </tr>\n                        </tbody>\n                    </table>\n\n                </td>\n                <td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n                <td class=\"tcol2\">\n                    <i> “Life on the off-world colonies is an adventure,”</i> they said. <br />\n                    <i>“Start a new life with the prospect of untold riches,”</i> they said.<br /><br />\n                    What they didn’t say was that the colony worlds are tough and unforgiving, and while opportunities for making a fortune do exist, it always seems to happen to the other guy.\n                    But your chance will come—you are a surveyor, a prospector, a miner, and an explorer—and if there are treasures out here, you will find them.\n                    And then you can sell your claim to one of the corporations for a fortune.\n                    <br /><br />\n                    Frontier Colonists are blue-collar working stiffs, and they follow up rumors, take chances on speculation or simply go in blind, to locate and extract valuable raw materials or salvage abandoned technology.\n                    Their skills and tenacity are sought after by third parties not willing to brave the dangers of the Outer Rim themselves. <br />\n                    Finding the big bucks to fund your own expedition is not easy.

Although impoverished and overcrowded, in the UPP the workers control the means of production. A state of cold war exists between the UPP and their long-time rivals, the UA—and standoffs between the Union of Progressive Peoples’ Space Operating Forces and the United States Colonial Marine Corps become more and more frequent every year.</span>  </p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">H I S T O R Y</span></h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> In the early 22nd Century, the UPP was formed by China and Russia in direct response to a perceived combined threat of the Three World Empire and the United Americas. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Locked in an ever-escalating arms race with these capitalist conglomerates, the UPP has always managed to stay only one step behind them despite the fact that they will not deal with Weyland-Yutani or any other corporations. Additional member states include Vietnam, Germany, Spain, and several other Asian and Eastern European countries. At the time of its inception, many androids were already in use within the member states of the UPP. They were not, however, granted citizenship status of any kind. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Now, over sixty years later, they are still just considered machines and the property of the state.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">L E A D E R S</span></h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The UPP is a socialist government with a president as the head of state and a premier who presides over the state council. The UPP Frontier is overseen by a Governor General (<a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.qljqTQwzeeOjstz8.JournalEntryPage.43EgvaKlRiuI9LZr\" data-id=\"43EgvaKlRiuI9LZr\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">PHAM DINH</a>) and naval task force, and each colony has its own mayor.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">L O C A T I O N S</span> </span></h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> Most of the discovered planets within their borders are resource poor, causing the UPP to constantly push deeper into the Frontier in search of rich, habitable worlds. As the UPP never developed atmospheric processors, they do not terraform. Instead, if a world is inhospitable, they will build a colony beneath the surface or construct habitation domes upon it. Because of this, the scattering of naturally habitable worlds the UPP has are overpopulated.</span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> Notable worlds include New Kiev, Qi Xi III, 17 Phei Phei, Xiang Colony, and the Chiu and Wan An outposts.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">R E L A T I O N S</span></h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> The UPP is in a state of cold war with the United Americas. Over the past few decades, limited engagements have seen border worlds change hands or even be destroyed. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Some twenty years ago, a regime change on the independent world of 8 Eta Boötis A III led to what became known as the Tientsin campaign—a bloody conflict where the UA backed an independent planet’s attempt to keep a UPP aligned government from taking power. The conflict decimated the once lush world and left it in ruins. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">More recently, the UPP are rumored to be behind the destruction of both the colony on LV-426 and a Colonial Marine rescue team. The allegations are that a UPP Space Operating Force nuked the site from orbit in response to a Weyland-Yutani bioweapon under development there. Ironically, while it was W-Y who accused the UPP of the attack, they also deny there were any bioweapons at Hadley’s Hope. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Much of the UPP’s more advanced technology appears to be reverse engineered from W-Y designs, something that neither Weyland-Yutani nor the UA are particularly happy about.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">M I L I T A R Y AND O R G A N I Z A T I O N S</span></h2>\n    <h3>SPACE OPERATING FORCES:</h3>\n    <p>The elite commandos of the UPP are known as the Space Operating Forces. Said to be roughly equivalent to the United States Colonial Marines, the SOF has a similar regimental breakdown. They maintain a fleet of warships and transport vessels, have their own dropships, and use massive, two-story armored trucks for troop deployment. While the SOF have their own AK model pulse rifle, they also use wrist-mounted AK suit guns that allow hands free firing while wearing compression armor.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h3>MINISTRY OF SPACE SECURITY:</h3>\n    <p>A national security agency and secret police, the MSS gathers both internal and external intelligence for the good of the Union of Progressive Peoples. The Ministry maintains a number of operatives throughout the Frontier, undercover on both UPP controlled worlds and United American colonies. MSS spies have infiltrated top corporations and stolen their military designs. They monitor their own citizenry to make sure they stay true to the Union. In the UPP, they say trust your enemy to be your enemy, but never trust your neighbor to be your friend. The MSS is why.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">C U R R E N T  A C T I V I T I E S</span></h2>\n    <p>The people of the UPP are hungry. As the UPP discovers a new planet on the Frontier, colonization ships are immediately dispatched to help alleviate the overpopulation problem of their existing member worlds.</p>\n    <p>Citizens don't get to decide who is moved to a new colony world. They are simply moved for the greater good of the Union.</p>\n    <p>These expansionist tendencies have the United Americas concerned, and a large amount of Colonial Navy and Marine resources are devoted to protecting borders from UPP incursions.</p>\n    <p>There have been many false alarms.</p>\n    <p>Imagine the relief a two-man Colonial Marshal office feels when an armada of UPP ships entering a neighboring system turns out to be a colonization expedition and not a warfleet.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n</div>",

In the early 21st century, humanity stood on a precipice.\n        Increased carbon emissions, inappropriate disposal of toxic wastes, limited nuclear exchanges, and overpopulation led to the mass extinction of several species, rampant disease, environmental decay, a worldwide energy crisis, and famine. <br /><br />\n        While stagnant governments were reluctant to change to meet these threats, multinational corporations headed by innovators like Peter Weyland stepped up and led the charge into the future. As many nations shut down their space programs, the private sector poured money and resources into pushing humanity out into the greater solar system and beyond. While politicians argued over global warming and health care, corporations set about repairing the ozone layer and curing most cancers. Establishing off-world colonies within the solar system, corporations gave humanity new places to flourish rather than wither on a damaged Earth. <br /><br />As Weyland-Yutani and other companies explored the stars, they established extrasolar colonies before there was any legislation in place to govern them. As these worlds flourished, it was the corporations that made policy. Realizing their technological dependence on companies like Weyland-Yutani to both travel to and terraform these planets in the first place, the governments of Earth had no choice but to play by company rules. At the mercy of these corporate overlords, nations soon found themselves in severe financial debt to them. <br /><br />Looking to the late 20th century’s formation of the European Union for inspiration, the major countries of the world soon merged to form larger nations. Dire economic necessity coupled with diminishing resources soon led to the unprecedented political merging of cultures that had been at odds in the past. During the last quarter of the 21st century, the Three World Empire was formed. The United Americas and the Union of Progressive Peoples soon followed, and governments began to regain some semblance of their old power. But the military industrial complex, interstellar commerce, and deep space mining all keep the system going, and you need the corporations to take care of that. <br /><br /><em>Without them, the economy would collapse. </em><br /><br />The current depression on the Frontier is symptomatic of this political and corporate tug of war. Government control is an illusion, and it’s a bad card trick at that. You can be assured that behind every politician is a corporate overlord exerting some form of control. <br /><br />What follows is a look at both the puppets and puppeteers of the 2180s.\n    </p>\n    <br /><br />\n    <h2>THE COMPANY YOU KEEP:</h2>\n    <p>Weyland-Yutani doesn't own everything, just mostly everything.

The two companies were so renowned for their corporate takeovers that the circumstances behind their merger became murky. While it is known that Weyland Corp had suffered severe financial losses with the failure of the Prometheus mission and the deaths of both company founder Peter Weyland and CEO Meredith Vickers, it is also true that Yutani had suffered many setbacks as well. <br />Conflicting insider information versus media reports make it questionable as to whether it was Yutani or Weyland who performed a hostile takeover on the other—and the company board likes it that way. The company inherited and expanded upon the technologies and products of its founders, including FTL drives, artificial intelligence, and deep surveillance equipment. Already leaders in the mining and shipping of extrasolar resources, by the 2130s they decided to get back into terraforming with a comparatively inexpensive and less safe redesign of Weyland Corp atmospheric processors. Over the next 30 years they established many new colony worlds within the American Arm of the Outer Rim Territories, in the process becoming the United Americas’ chief supplier of weapons and starships. </span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <table style=\"border-color:black;width:600px;border:0\">\n        <tbody>\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"width:239px\">\n                    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">L E A D E R S</span></h2>\n                    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> Like any major corporation, Weyland-Yutani is run by a board of directors and shareholders.

Unfortunately, most of the information Weyland-Yutani has gathered about the Xenomorph and its subspecies is based on secondhand reports, and therefore these teams are often ill-equipped to deal with the actual threat the creatures represent.</span>  </td>\n            </tr>\n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">L O C A T I O N S</span> </span></h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Weyland-Yutani has main offices in Tokyo, London, San Francisco, Sea of Tranquility, and on Thedus.

As such, they have a ruthless and cutthroat reputation in the corporate world. Despite the fact that the company has a seat in the Interstellar Commerce Commission’s Company Review Board their commercial fleet management is known to bribe both ICC agents and Colonial Marshals rather than submit their spacecraft to mandatory safety inspections. An uneasy alliance of convenience exists between W-Y and the United Americas, one that is currently straining both entities’ relationships with the Three World Empire. </span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">C U R R E N T  A C T I V I T I E S</span></h2>\n    <p>Weyland-Yutani is operating top secret R&amp;D facilities throughout the territories, specializing in illegal development of synthetic and biochemical weapons. For decades, a major focus of said research has been the procurement of both Chemical A0-3959X.91-15 and for use as biochemical self-replicating weapons. <br />After the incidents on LV-426 and Fiorina 161, W-Y has doubled down on their efforts. Orbital research facilities like RB-232 “The Cold Forge” and Odobenus station have spent considerable time and effort researching the Xenomorphs, but a method of safely containing them still eludes the company. Special “Dog Catcher” commando and science teams under the supervision of Michael Bishop explore the Frontier in search of Xenomorph XX121 hive worlds, archaeological ruins belonging to the Engineers, and viable alien specimens. W-Y is also covertly developing aggressive X-stimulants, hardwired cybernetic integrated exo-suits, and illegal combat androids for the USCMC.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p> </p>\n</div>",

Well known for their award winning A.P.O.L.L.O. AI mainframe and low-end synthetics, Seegson first gained notoriety by sharing their inventions and pooling their resources with smaller companies.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\">H I S T O R Y</h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> One of the innovators of spaceflight in the 2030s, Sieg and Son was founded in direct competition to Weyland Corp. Having patented their own FTL displacement drive system, Sieg and Son shared their technologies with other companies, ensuring that Weyland wasn’t the only one to make it to the stars. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">By the 2070s they were operating major production plants across the globe, the Sieg family had sold back their shares to the company and Sieg and Son was condensed to Seegson. The company entered the synthetic market in the early 2100s with their Working Joe model androids. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Nowhere near as advanced as Weyland’s David or Walter series, the Working Joes have a more rudimentary intelligence and are designed to perform maintenance and menial tasks. Rather than being indistinguishable from humans, they have cheap rubberized skin that gives them the appearance of animate mannequins. Usable as an inexpensive labor force, the Working Joes sold well on the ever-shifting Frontier. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Successful in so many arenas, Seegson made one investment error that would cripple them for decades. Lacking a patent on atmospheric processors, Seegson put its funding into extrasolar deep space orbital platform colonies. As Weyland-Yutani terraformed more worlds, Seegson’s stock began to plummet. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Even the harsher worlds proved more attractive to colonists than life inside a tin can floating through space. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">By 2140, most of Seegson’s space stations had been placed on the market. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Today, the company survives through its sales on backwater colonies and on the Frontier, where everything needs to be cheap and reliable. </span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\">L E A D E R S</h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Seegson is a publicly traded company run by a board of directors.

Their home offices are in London, Buenos Aires, Nagasaki and on Luna, the Solomons, and Anchorpoint. They still operate a few deep space stations as R&amp;D platforms.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\">R E L A T I O N S</h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Seegson has lucrative contracts with the Independent Core System Colonies and the Three World Empire. Their business affiliates include Geofund, Gemini Exoplanet Solutions, and Gustafsson Enterprise Ltd. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">While Seegson is always looking to score big over Weyland-Yutani, W-Y does not consider them a threat at all. Like W-Y, Seegson is looking to secure specimens of Xenomorph XX121 for study and evaluation.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\">P R O D U C T S</h2>\n    <p>Seegson is known for its work in security and communications, its credit services, and the A.P.O.L.L.O. AI computer mainframe.</p>\n    <p>They are major producers of space and ground vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and their mannequin-like “Working Joe” line of cost-effective synthetics.</p>\n    <p>While they maintain an impressive array of product lines, Seegson’s wares are considered somewhat inferior to those produced by Weyland-Yutani.</p>\n    <p>The Colonial Times has even referred to Seegson merchandise as \"cheap knockoffs.”</p>\n    <p>Still, an independent colony that couldn't afford a W-Y security system would do almost as well with one from Seegson, and their A.P.O.L.L.O. mainframe system continues to be a popular and cost effective choice for starship and colony management on the Frontier.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\">C U R R E N T  A C T I V I T I E S</h2>\n    <p>Seegson is actively attempting to sabotage W-Y interests on the Frontier.</p>\n    <p>Unfortunately, they also have the making of a scandal on their hands.</p>\n    <p>A large shipment of Seegson’s Working Joe synthetics was recently sold before their behavior inhibitors were installed, and these units went to an anonymous buyer on the Frontier.</p>\n    <p>While unsubstantiated, some believe these androids were purchased by a would-be petty dictator for use in a backwater planetary coup. Others believe these Working Joes were covertly commissioned by the UPP for use as an artificial combat unit, and still other worry that the omission of the inhibitor programming was but a simple error with the potential for disastrous ramifications.</p>\n    <p>The thought of synthetics capable of murder introduced into the civilian population is one no colonial administrator or marshal wants to contemplate.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n</div>",

W-Y VP Brendan Lasalle quit over the firings, citing “creative differences” as the cause. He obtained start-up funds and assembled those laid off to create Lasalle Bionational. It wasn’t long before his company acquired a lucrative government contract to produce an inexpensive, radiation-resistant corn substitute, as well as a blight virus that would destroy an enemy’s crops, securing their place in the market. </span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">L E A D E R S</span></h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Bionational is owned and operated by the Lasalle family, handed down from father to daughter <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.qljqTQwzeeOjstz8.JournalEntryPage.gS0gAcnMdXfnvtfK\" data-id=\"gS0gAcnMdXfnvtfK\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">EDINA LASALLE</a>.

His focus over the past few years has been to obtain viable specimens of p.praepotens for bioweapons research. He almost achieved his goal when confronting Ellen Ripley at the Fiorina 161 Class C Work Correctional Unit, but her suicide by immolation there prevented him from obtaining his prize.<br />During the incident Michael suffered severe head trauma and has since received extensive corrective surgery and cybernetic implants in order to repair the damage to his skull.<br />Unfortunately, the doctors have been unable to control his severe migraines and red-outs, and Michael has become dependent on highly addictive painkillers. Never one to throw in the towel, Michael has since operated on the Frontier, tracking down any Xenomorph XX121 leads and sightings in the hopes of capturing one and weaponizing it. His corporate transport ship the Patna can frequently be found docked at the W-Y corporate berth on Anchorpoint Station.</span>\n</div>",

dice, or by choosing the table entries you prefer.\n        Re-roll results which seem out of place.\n        It is likely that the mission will take the PCs to a system different from the one that

likely to be spending your time trying to build a life and make a buck.\n            While the Outer Rim might be beyond the Outer Veil, the void is vast, and the Frontier cuts through the Outer Veil and Outer Rim before moving on into the unknown depths of space.\n            Sectors which touch upon the Frontier include Tartarus, Bao Sau, and Sector 87.\n            As such, some planets and systems on the Frontier are also located within those areas.\n            Frontier stations such as Anchorpoint act as a neutral zone for all corporations and governments.\n            Backwater colonies like Bowen’s Landing, LV-492, and LV-422 lie on the Frontier along the Far Reach of the American Arm—an area of UA aggressive expansion that extends well past the Outer Rim.\n            While part of the United Americas and protected by the Outer Rim Defense Fleet, mining and shipping hubs like Thedus and the Solomons are open to all entrepreneurs and pioneers.\n            There are well-established star lanes to and from these distant worlds, but the space those routes cross through is between Frontier zones and therefore uncharted, unexplored, and dangerous.\n            It’s always recommended that ships stay at FTL speeds in these sectors.\n\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <h2 class=\"heading\">KHADAJI SYSTEM</h2>\n        <p>\n            The mineral rich Khadaji

allegiances hasn't helped the Wells colony prosper, but has instead helped line the pockets of many corporate execs.\n                        The Wells lies directly over a massive natural spring that produces fresh water with naturally occurring electrolytes—making it a favorite of the elite and sought after in the Inner Core Systems.\n                        <br />\n                        Contracts with several corporate concerns see that the moon is heavily mined for its water, iron, and uranium reserves which are sold at a premium while the colonists are forced to live in squalor.\n                        As petitions for better living standards have been ignored by the greater United American government, a small South American state has seen the plight of the Wells colony as a means to gain more power in the UA.\n                        As such, they have begun encouraging the rebels to sabotage supply lines while making demands for better wages and supplies.\n

Dubbed Terraform 3, the planet listed below is actually the third attempt to terraform a planet in the Gamma Leporis system.\n            The first, orbiting Gamma Leporis B, ended in catastrophic failure when an asteroid collided with the planet.\n            The second is more confusing. Contact was lost with the Seegson sponsored terraforming colony orbiting Gamma Leporis C in 2175.\n            When the company went to investigate, they found that all the colonists had simply disappeared without a trace. The colony itself was undisturbed, save for the fact that the atmospheric processor had been shut down.\n            The planet is generally avoided and whatever happened remains a mystery to this day.\n            <br />\n            Finally, the Gamma Leporis system is one of many locations of mysterious \"ghost ship\" sightings of the lost USCMC Conestoga-class troop transport the Sulaco.\n

Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway, and company founder Peter Weyland himself.\n                Here, the expedition discovered a series of temples built by an alien race that Dr. Shaw referred to as “the Engineers.”\n                Investigating the nearest structure, the crew found evidence of a toxic outbreak that wiped out the Engineer outpost.\n                That toxin was Chemical A0-3959X.91–15, a viscous black fluid that acts as an evolutionary accelerant on any biological host it contaminates.\n                <br />\n                Through a series of tragic events, some of the crew became infected with the accelerant, resulting in many deaths.\n                A lone Engineer awoken from cryosleep killed Peter Weyland and most of the remainder of the crew.\n                As the Engineer attempted to launch one of its species’ Juggernaut spacecraft on a mission to wipe out humanity, Captain Janek of the Prometheus ignited the SEV’s ion drive in the atmosphere and rammed the alien vessel.\n                The Prometheus was obliterated and the Juggernaut crippled.\n                Only Dr. Shaw and the mission’s synthetic, David 8, survived, escaping LV-223 in another Engineer Juggernaut and heading towards the ubiquitous Planet 4 in Sector 87.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"rightcol\">\n            <p style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n                Much of what was there when the USCSS Prometheus was destroyed remains on LV-223 nearly one hundred years later.\n                Contaminated by the released accelerant, however, the planet has undergone a metamorphosis in the valley where the damaged Juggernaut crashed.\n                A lush jungle has taken root, producing a breathable atmosphere for those that stay in the area.\n                Abhorrent mutated creatures inhabit the jungle zone, and a strange biomechanical structure has grown there—a living mountain that the moon’s fauna are wary to approach.\n                <br />\n                The Engineer temples and Juggernaut hangers beneath them are still intact, as is a vast supply of Engineer ampules filled with Chemical A0-3959X.91–15.\n                It’s power cells long dead, the Prometheus’ lifeboat still lies on the surface, as does a surprise: the Class 7 Excavator Vessel known as the Onager.\n                A short range orbital craft assigned to Hadley’s Hope, the ship was used by a group of colonists from Acheron to escape the alien infestation of their colony and make an emergency landing here.\n                Unfortunately, they brought several Plagiarus praepotens with them, and the Xenomorph species turned the Onager into a makeshift hive. <br />\n                The colonists are believed dead.\n                Just like all other biological life, the Xenomorphs have proven to be susceptible to the accelerant as well—resulting in bizarre mutations amongst the hive.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:650px\">\n        <table class=\"ntable\">\n            <caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n                <b>A NOTE FROM MU/TH/UR: </b>\n            </caption>\n            <tbody>\n                <tr>\n                    <td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n                        Evolution out of control, the situation on LV-223 is insanely dangerous.

  With a rotation period of two hours and a gravity of .86 Earth Standard, the moon called LV-426 is a barren and inhospitable rock in space.\n                Daytime is a perpetual twilight and nighttime is cold and dark.\n                Cataloged by a French deep space probe in the 2040s, the moon remained unexplored for the next century.\n                In 2122, the USCSS Nostromo touched down on LV-426 in response to an unknown distress call, allegedly encountering a hostile alien life form that eventually led to the ship’s destruction at the hands of one of the crew.\n                However, when the moon was extensively surveyed in the 2130s, it was discovered that it had no indigenous life, calling the Nostromo rumors into question. <br />\n                LV-426 is perhaps best known as the site of the doomed colony Hadley’s Hope.\n                Thirty-five years after the Nostromo incident, Weyland-Yutani and the Colonial Administration set up an atmospheric processor on the swiftly turning moon and began terraforming procedures.\n                The moon was renamed Acheron by its early settlers, and Hadley’s Hope endured there for more than twenty years.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"rightcol\">\n            <p>\n                The colony stopped transmitting reports in July of 2179, prompting a visit by a contingent of colonial marines.\n                Whatever transpired next led to the nuclear annihilation of the colony and the death of both the colonial marine unit and all 158 colonists.\n                What caused the destruction is uncertain—conflicting reports range from an attack by a rival government or unknown alien species to a simple reactor accident and meltdown.\n                All that remains is a radioactive wasteland stretching over 700 km. <br />\n                Soon after the incident, both Weyland-Yutani and the Colonial Marines sent search and rescue teams to Acheron in the hopes of finding survivors.\n                While the colony and the atmospheric processor were vaporized, it was theoretically possible that any colonists who made it as far as the Ilium Range would be protected from the blast by the mountains there.\n                The company set up a relief station in orbit, but no survivors were ever found.\n                Called Kathar Station, it is now a minor research platform maintained by a custodial staff.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:1142px\">\n        <table class=\"bigtable\">\n

Engineer Juggernaut with a cargo bay full of alien eggs.\n                Ship’s first officer Kane was subsequently attacked by a facehugger and impregnated with a Plagiarus praepotens embryo which, when fully formed, began stalking the crew.\n                With no Queen present, the alien initiated the ovomorphing transformation on Captain Dallas and technician Brett, converting their bodies into viable alien eggs.\n                Third officer Ellen Ripley set the ship to self-destruct and escaped on the shuttlecraft Narcissus, finally killing the creature by blowing it out of the airlock and blasting it with a burst from the shuttle’s engines.\n                <br />\n                In 2137, Captain Marlow of the deep space salvage vessel Anesidora also traced the signal back to the derelict, and shut it down—but not before his wife was impregnated by a facehugger.Decades passed.\n                The derelict all but forgotten, the colony of Hadley’s Hope was established

You are the Xeno­morph.\n      Being a GM takes some work but it is also very rewarding.\n      After all, you get to direct and star in your very own Alien movie.\n      This chapter tells you how to do it and what you’ll need. But the most important tool is your own imagination. Use it well.\n    </p>\n    <br /><br />\n    <p>\n      Eight basic principles underpin the game.\n      Their purpose is to help you set the right tone, and provide a support structure for handling various situations that can arise during play.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:22px\">\n    <div class=\"leftcol\">\n      <h2 class=\"heading\" style=\"text-align:center\">1 RIFF FROM THE MOVIES</h2>\n      <p>\n        We’ve all seen the ALIEN movies, most of us multiple times.\n        Use this fact in the game. Riff from dialogue, scenes, and characters.\n        Describe a corridor like one of the Nostromo’s walkways in Alien.\n        Base a character on one of the marines in Aliens.\n        Encourage the players to do the same. There’s plenty of source material to draw from. Use it.\n      </p>\n      <br /><br />\n      <h2 class=\"heading\" style=\"text-align:center\">3 STAY IN THE SHADOWS</h2>\n      <p>\n        Hint at the source of danger, don’t show it. Build up an atmosphere of dread and anticipation, then let the players’ imaginations do the rest.\n        Avoid revealing threats too early. Once the players know exactly what they are up against, the tension that results from facing the unknown is lost.\n      </p>\n      <br /><br />\n      <h2 class=\"heading\" style=\"text-align:center\">5 LET THEM BREATHE</h2>\n      <p>\n        At the center of every storm is a point of calmness.\n        Sometimes it’s important to back off and let the players take some time to recuperate.\n        Give the PC’s room to catch their breath and lick their wounds.\n        Let them make plans and adapt their strategy.\n        Doing so encourages them to lower their guard, even if it’s just for a moment.\n        When that happens, be sure to have a new challenge waiting.\n      </p>\n      <br /><br />\n      <h2 class=\"heading\" style=\"text-align:center\">7 BRING HORRIBLE DEATH</h2>\n      <p>\n        PCs will die and die horribly. When the time comes, make the most of it. Embrace death.\n        The Alien franchise is known for its iconic death scenes, so make it the same for your game.\n        A PC death can be gruesome and tragic, but sometimes cathartic too.\n        It raises the stakes for the survivors, who need to up their game and find a way to press on.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"rightcol\">\n      <h2 class=\"heading\" style=\"text-align:center\">2 LIMIT THEIR RESOURCES</h2>\n      <p>\n        Always make sure that the PCs have too little of something. Not enough ammo, just one gun to share, one compression suit less than the number of PCs.\n        Scarcity of resources creates tension and forces the players to make difficult choices.\n      </p>\n      <br /><br />\n      <h2 class=\"heading\" style=\"text-align:center\">4 INCREASE THE PRESSURE</h2>\n      <p>\n        Start easy and slowly add more and more complications to the situation.\n        Think like a movie—the first act starts slow, then it accelerates towards the big finale. When things start to go wrong, let them go wrong all at once.\n        Remember, this is a horror game. Force the PCs to fight for their lives.\n      </p>\n      <br /><br />\n      <h2 class=\"heading\" style=\"text-align:center\">6 FUEL THEIR AGENDAS</h2>\n      <p>\n        The PCs are living and breathing characters in the world of ALIEN, each with their own agendas and goals.\n        Learn their agendas by heart and feed into them.\n        Put them in situations that directly challenge their goals and see how they react. Use their fragile humanity against them.\n\n      </p>\n      <br /><br />\n      <h2 class=\"heading\" style=\"text-align:center\">8 REVEAL THE UNIVERSE</h2>\n      <p>\n        The universe of ALIEN is harsh and unforgiving.\n        But it’s also home to long-lost secrets, wondrous planets and strange phenomena.\n        Now and then, give the PCs a glimpse of something bigger.\n        Let them feel the vastness of the universe and the insignificance of humanity. Show them the beauty and the horror\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:1066px\">\n    <table class=\"ntable\">\n      <caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n        <b>KNOWING THE UNKNOWABLE</b>\n      </caption>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n            Uncertainty is the mother of fear.\n            The players may have seen the movies, but the PCs sure haven’t.\n            Change things around so that neither the players nor the PCs are certain of exactly what they are facing, or what will happen next.\n            Maybe they are up against a different kind of enemy?\n            Maybe this Xenomorph behaves in an unexpected way.\n            Never let them be certain of anything.

destroying the colony on Tartarus.\n                These large, fast moving burrowers have tiny, useless eyes, instead utilizing sonar to navigate.\n                They have massive front claws and a mouth with a unique shredding mechanism that grinds organic materials and stores it in one of six stomachs.\n                This mouth acts like a rotating circular meat grinder, crushing and pulping flesh, bone, plants, wood, rock and most metals.\n                Only the strongest of materials will resist destruction, causing the Harvester to choke until the offending item is removed.\n                <br />\n                Typical targets of opportunity include farmlands, graveyards, food stores, or a gathering of people or animals.\n                While Harvesters don’t actually hunt living things, any creatures unlucky enough to be in their feeding zone are fodder.\n                As the air in their natural habitat is higher in carbon dioxide than the human norm, Harvesters are capable of breathing in otherwise poisonous atmospheres.\n                They carry their young beneath the folds of their armored shell—boar-sized creatures that will detach themselves and attack if their mother is overwhelmed.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"rightcol\">\n            <p>\n                While native to Tartarus, some corporate exec at Bionational got it in his head that the Harvesters could be used to tunnel out mines on other metal rich worlds.\n                They were transported to several mining planets and moons on the Frontier and did so—before escaping into the wild and disrupting those colonies as well.\n                <br /><br />\n                <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">HIDDEN BEHEMOTH:</strong>\n                When at rest the Harvester often sleeps just under the surface, with a thin crust of ground above it.\n                If someone walks across this ground they get an OBSERVATION roll to spot the weakened earth, but if not it will collapse under them and the startled Harvester will get a free attack.\n                <br /><br />\n                <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">HARVESTER JUVENILES:</strong>\n                A mother Harvester will carry up to 2D6 young safely under her armor plating.\n                If she comes under attack and is in genuine danger these young will leap to her defense and attack too, rolling four Base Dice, Damage 1.\n                <br /><br />\n                <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong>\n                These things are large-scale destroyers.\n                The inhabitants of Tartarus Colony lured the creatures to the surface and attacked them with aircraft with limited success before the beasts learned to avoid such traps.\n                The best way to kill a rampaging Harvester is to attack its soft, unprotected underbelly—but good luck getting close enough to do so without being crushed or ground up.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"aframe\"

nature with a bulbous, trunked head.\n                This is in fact a removable living pressure suit that melds with the Engineer’s body, with the “head” actually being a helmet of some type.\n                These living suits and helmets have only been found dead—ossified and fossilized over millennia of disuse.\n                Underneath their strange garb, the Engineers are statuesque.\n                They have hairless, chiseled physiques with translucent blue-white skin, heavy brows, high noses, and large, glassy black eyes.\n                They are both beautiful and powerful in appearance.\n                While they were once believed to be all male, there is now evidence to suggest that female Engineers exist as well.\n                Dr. Shaw theorized that the females operated in a leadership capacity while the males assumed soldier, artisan, and philosopher roles, but there is no evidence to support this.\n                Females are equally hairless and just as dangerous.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"rightcol\" style=\"top:34px\">\n            <table class=\"ntable\">\n                <caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n

Some theories suggest there are different breeds or castes of Engineers with physical alternatives bred into them—thereby differentiating civilian and militant factions.\n                            Others have postulated that not all the crumbling edifices unearthed on the Frontier are those of the Engineers, but that some belong to other species seeded by or cross-bred with them. <br />\n

Jockey” specimen reportedly witnessed by two starfreighter crews and colonists from Hadley’s Hope, some xenoanthropologists suggest the Engineers based their biomechanical technology on creatures greater than themselves — strange beings of immense size replete with pachydermic probosci.\n                            However, since the specimen in question was unfortunately destroyed and there

stone head.\n                It is believed these heads are meant to represent one of six elders of their civilization—intellectuals, artists, and wise men.\n                Their culture appears to be steeped in both the sciences and the arts.\n                In addition to their biotechnological wonders, beautifully painted murals and bas reliefs of bizarre alien creatures adorn the walls of their innermost sanctums.\n                While not yet understood, their computer interfaces work on a combination of musical initiation plus the manipulation of depressible hieroglyphic symbols and rubbery, egg-shaped control nodules.\n                There is evidence of terraforming at many of their sites, via a method that company scientists so far cannot explain.\n                Vast

the crux of Engineer society.\n                It has been hypothesized that they can see melodies as colors, shapes, and words. As such, music is key to operating most of their technology.\n                Different flutes function as keys to unlock different doors and technology, and playing different tones on these flutes will trigger different functions, such as turning on the lights, starting a juggernaut, plotting a navigational course, or even unlocking a biosuit.\n                <br />\n                An android or human possessing a particular talent for music could conceivably learn to whistle the appropriate tones to activate and operate Engineer technology, but it is an exceedingly difficult skill to master.\n                <br /><br />\n                <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">ENGINEER BIOSUIT:</strong>\n                It has been theorized that these pressure suits increase the wearer’s strength, help them to process toxins, and act as armor against ballistic weaponry.\n                Helmeted, one of these suits will keep an Engineer alive in the vacuum of space.\n                Scientists believe an engineer could survive in a toxic environment for at least one hour sans helmet, as the biosuit will breath for them.\n                The biosuit also acts as an advanced medkit, repairing damage to the Engineer’s body and providing the wearer with limited sustenance.\n                <br /><br />\n                <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">ENGINEER REBREATHER:</strong>\n                Usually used by Engineers when placed in cryosleep, these bioengineered masks insert a tube down the wearer’s throat and feed oxygen directly to their lungs.\n                <br /><br />\n                <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SARCOPHAGI:</strong>\n                Resembling large, translucent coffins, these Engineer hypersleep tubes can keep someone alive in suspended animation for centuries, if not millennia.\n                An Engineer rebreather must be worn while in the chamber.\n                <br /><br />\n                <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">HOLOGRAPHY:</strong>\n                Engineers record everything within their installations using a memory gel that coats the interior walls and ceiling.\n                When the proper electrostatic currents are channeled through the gel, holographic playback will occur in the actual environment, producing fuzzy, blue particle representations of various recorded events.\n                Most evidence of the Engineer’s past actions have come from such recordings.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"rightcol\">\n            <p>\n                <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">ORRERY:</strong>\n                Engineer holographic maps of the galaxy are extremely detailed and interactive, allowing viewers to simply pluck a photonic representation of a world out of the air and have its statistics and coordinates feed directly into a navigational system.\n                Orreries are located on the bridge of an Engineer ship and sometimes serve as observatories or command centers within Engineer installations.\n                <br /><br />\n                <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">JUGGERNAUTS:</strong>\n                These massive, asymmetrical, horseshoe-shaped craft appear more grown than built.\n                Each ship contains at least one massive cargo bay with an ampule delivery system (see the ampule entry below).\n                These ships usually have four to eight hypersleep chambers arranged around a central dais on the upper level of the ship’s center.\n                In the middle of this dais is a retractable pilot's seat that interfaces with the pilot and makes them one with the ship.\n                The entire chamber can be used to display a map of the galaxy, homing in on any world or system and charting a course to the desired location.\n                Juggernauts are theorized to be war machines or bombers of some kind and are capable of FTL speeds that rival our own.\n                <br /><br />\n                <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">MOTHER JUGGERNAUT:</strong>\n                Colossal craft shaped like a scorpion’s tail, Engineer motherships are defensive docking stations that hover over and protect major Engineer installations and cities.\n                Juggernauts and other Engineer craft can dock with a Mothership to replenish their energies and supplies.\n                <br /><br />\n                <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">DREADNOUGHTS:</strong>\n                While none have yet to be seen, Dreadnoughts are hypothetical Engineer battleships.\n                Partially translated hieroglyphics seem to indicate that these twisted, knot-shaped craft are larger than juggernauts but still follow the same design philosophy.\n                Dreadnoughts are believed to be extremely weaponized and FTL capable.\n                <br /><br />\n                <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">STEATITE AMPULES:</strong> Metallic storage containers roughly a half a meter tall, these urns each contain four glass conical containers—each of which in turn contains a strain of the Engineer’s greatest creation—the genetic accelerant called Agent A0-3959X.91-15.\n                Hermetically sealed, the urns are designed to release the black goo in response to pressure, temperature and other environmental changes.\n                These are exceptionally dangerous and should be avoided.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>",

Ellen Ripley.\n                    As the Sulaco’s computers were subsequently damaged, it is unclear if there were one or two facehuggers birthed aboard at the time—but what is clear is that one was able to produce a royal embryo.\n                    Once the unsuspecting survivors entered hypersleep, the newly hatched creature attempted to gain entry to Jorden’s cryotube, accidentally causing an electrical fire in the Sulaco’s hypersleep chambers.\n                    The ship’s MU/TH/UR ejected the EEV pod, launching Ripley, Corporal Hicks, Rebecca Jorden, and the Sulaco’s Bishop android towards Fury 161.\n                    Their pod eventually crashed into the ocean near the correctional facility.\n                    Hicks and Jorden did not survive the crash, and the Bishop android was damaged beyond repair.\n                    Lt. Ripley was soon found to be gestating a Queen within her.\n                    Either the royal facehugger was able to produce two embryos—an ability that W-Y scientists have hypothesized but been unable to confirm—or a second facehugger was also aboard the EEV with them.\n                    Regardless of the culprit, one of the facility’s domestic animals was subsequently impregnated with the Runner variety of p.praepotens.\n                    The Runner managed to slaughter all the convicts and staff except for Morse and prison guard Francis Aaron.\n                    Because of the unborn Queen Ripley carried, the Runner left her unmolested.\n                    Aware that the lieutenant was a carrier, Weyland-Yutani dispatched CEO Michael Bishop and a crack medical team to retrieve the embryo.\n                    As they arrived, Ripley and Morse managed to put down the Runner.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"rightcol\">\n                <p style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n                    Aaron attacked Michael and was killed by company commandos, and Ripley threw herself into the leadworks furnace to prevent the company from acquiring the Queen.\n                    After the incident, Weyland-Yutani examined the leadworks and prison facilities, hoping to find any trace of alien DNA.\n                    Although they were able to collect blood samples of Lt. Ripley that were taken by Dr. Clemens before her death, no viable p.praepotens genetic material was found.\n                    The company ordered the site closed and put the equipment there up for sale as scrap. Not all the quinitricetyline was used up in the inmates’ bid to rid the prison of the star beast.\n                    While most of the facility on Fury 161 has been stripped and prepped for scrap, Weyland-Yutani has yet to find any buyers for it—and that includes the remaining drums stored there.\n                    But that’s not all.The Weyland-Yutani team assigned to comb the facility wasn’t as thorough as they could have been—likely because their corporate masters were reluctant to explain exactly what they were looking for.\n                    Deep in the bowels of the long abandoned sections of the facility lie the beginnings of a secreted resin hive.\n                    Just as the Drone Xenomorph aboard the Nostromo had done with Dallas and Brett, the Fury 161 Runner had been creating a nest and had already begun the process of transforming Superintendent Andrews and inmates Boggs and Rains into contingency ovomorphs.\n                    <br />\n                    Other parties have since taken interest in Morse’s Space Beast, and it’s only a matter of time before someone sends their own covert team to investigate.\n                    For now, the Fury 161 alien eggs lay dormant, waiting for someone to stumble upon them\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:790px\">\n\n            <h2

disappointing.\n                            The planetoid spins too slowly and is too small to capture its own atmosphere.\n                            The only thing of note in the system is the listening and monitoring post Znoy (Russian for “Heat”).\n                            Znoy is but one of many such posts across the UPP border, all connected by a grid of sensor satellites that record any incursions.\n                            Unfortunately, the sensors are rudimentary at best, so it is often difficult for the outpost staff to determine if an invasion fleet is on its way or if the grid has simply registered a rogue comet or stellar debris.\n                            While new arrivals here scramble to alert the UPP SOF Command of any contact, old timers know the drill.\n                            Znoy Outpost is mostly underground, having been driven into the rock like a giant stake.\n                            During the day, the outpost unfurls a solar shield to both protect it from the direct heat and to harness the star’s rays and recharge its power cells.\n\n\n                        </td>\n                        <td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n

while a “night” lasts about 28 Earth days.\n                            Supply ships can only approach when the outpost is on the night side, as the planetoid itself shields the transports from the extreme heat of the sun.\n                            <br />\n                            Assignment to Znoy is considered a punishment.\n                            It is understaffed and ill-equipped to face even an unlikely invasion that might come through this area.\n                            While it is equipped with system-wide orbital nuclear arrays, the outpost itself has only two dropships and four heat-shielded tracked vehicles for surface operations.\n                            To make matters worse for the soldiers assigned there, Znoy is the closest UPP military installation to Zeta Reticuli, and the United Americas Allied Command is investigating the possibility that a UPP strike was launched there against Hadley’s Hope.\n                            If such an attack did happen, the UAAC believes it would have originated from Znoy.\n                        </td>\n                        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n                    </tr>\n

A range of them are presented below, but there are several others that will be detailed in further supplements. Each one of these xeno types is terrifying in its own way, and will give you something to suffer PTSD over—if you can get out alive.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:20px\">\n<div class=\"leftcol\">\n<h2 class=\"heading\" style=\"text-align:center\">GENERAL XENOMORPH RULES</h2>\n<p>In combat, Xeno­morphs follow special rules—primarily, they have a Speed rating and they have signature attacks. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SKILLS:</strong> Xeno­morphs don’t have Attributes like humans. They can use specific skills, and then roll a number of Base Dice equal to their skill level only. Xeno­morphs can have skill levels much higher than humans. They never push rolls. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">ARMOR RATING:</strong> Most Xeno­morphs also have a thick hide, resistant to attacks, giving them a natural Armor Rating. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">HEALTH:</strong> When a Xeno­morph is reduced to zero Health, it isn’t Broken in the way a human is. Instead, roll a D6 on the critical injury table to the right. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SPECIAL ABILITIES:</strong> Some Xeno­morphs have special actions beyond their signature attacks. This is specified under each Xeno­morph description</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rightcol\" style=\"top:34px\">\n<h2 class=\"heading\" style=\"text-align:center\">SPEED</h2>\n<p>Xeno­morphs are often much faster than human beings. This is represented by their Speed rating. <br />Speed has two uses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In stealth mode (see <a class=\"content-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-link data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.QXGYSNrL1piX6nRb\" data-id=\"QXGYSNrL1piX6nRb\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">STEALTH MODE</a>), the Xeno­morph can move two zones per point of <em>Speed</em> each Turn. Humans can move two zones, i.e. they have a Speed of 1.</li>\n<li>In combat, a Xeno­morph gets to act once for each point of Speed in each Round. Draw one initiative card for each point of Speed. At each point of action, the Xeno­morph gets to perform one fast and one slow action.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"heading\" style=\"text-align:center\">SIGNATURE ATTACKS</h2>\n<p>Most Xeno­morphs attack only in close combat, at <strong>ENGAGED</strong> range. However, they don’t make ordinary close-combat attacks. Instead, each time a Xeno­morph attacks, roll a D6 on a table for the creature’s signature attacks, and resolve the effects. Some signature attacks are extremely deadly. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">BLOCKING:</strong> Unless stated otherwise, a signature attack can be blocked (see <a class=\"content-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-link data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.pHhtjxcL0EM20LDe\" data-id=\"pHhtjxcL0EM20LDe\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">CLOSE COMBAT</a>), but doing so requires some form of weapon or blunt instrument.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:650px\">\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong> CRITICAL INJURIES ON XENOMORPHS </strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">D6</td>\n<td class=\"scol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">CRIT</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">EFFECT</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">1</td>\n<td class=\"scol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">Rise Again</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">The Xeno­morph falls to the ground, seemingly dead, but it’s a ruse.

It is believed that an ecological disaster there brought on by the release of Agent A0-3959X.91-15 in the atmosphere led to the accelerant settling on and mutating native fungal and insect life to produce a living nightmare. Similar to a Xeno­morph XX121, the Neomorph parasite (P. celerius) is delivered to a host via a carrier organism (Tachinidae tabellarium). Once implanted, the parasite gestates within a living host who is killed by the creature’s violent birth. There are a number of differences, however, causing the creature to be classified separately.</p>\n<div class=\"leftcol\">\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES:</strong> Appearance-wise, Neomorphs are eyeless and have gray-white translucent skin, a fleshy spiked tail, an elongated bulbous head, and a sphincter-like facial orifice that distends to reveal a mouth full of cruel teeth. While their blood is translucent yellow like that of a Xeno­morph, it is not acidic. They make subtle clicking sounds and exhibit animal snarls and screeches, as well as making a distinct hooting sound as adults. Neomorphs are more animalistic than their Xeno­morph brethren and are clearly not as intelligent.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rightcol\">\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">STAGES:</strong> A Neomorph’s life cycle is broken down into five known stages that are covered below, as well as various termination protocols associated with each stage. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">STERILIZATION:</strong> Neomorphs are genetically programmed to kill all life. Believed by some to be a derivative of the black liquid, P. celerius was likely designed by the Engineers to clear a planet of any indigenous species still living after Agent A0-3959X.91-15 had wiped out the majority of a planet’s population.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:986px\">\n<h2 class=\"heading\">STAGE I: NEOMORPHIC EGG SACS</h2>\n<div class=\"leftcol\">\n<p>Small, bulbous pods that grow like fungus, the egg sacs are the result of the mutagenic Agent A0-3959X.91-15 interacting with pollen and microbial elements on a planet or in a spacecraft. Once formed, these bird’s egg-sized pods tend to grow in clutches of 2D6 — and there are often several clutches in any infected area. The egg sacs are the delivery system for the Neomorphic Motes (see Stage II).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rightcol\">\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> The best way to be rid of the Egg Sacs is to expose them to severe temperature changes—they can be destroyed with fire or made inert with liquid nitrogen (at least until they thaw).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:1224px\">\n<h2 class=\"heading\">STAGE II: NEOMORPHIC MOTES</h2>\n<div class=\"leftcol\">\n<p>When the egg sacs are disturbed, they release what appears to be a puff of pollen. In reality, it is a synchronized swarm of highly infectious Tachinidae tabellarium motes. Smaller than grains of sand, these parasites are sometimes visible when clustering together to increase their locomotive capacities. Possessing a primal hive intelligence, the motes target the nearest potential host and zero-in on an unprotected orifice such as the eyes, ears, nose, throat, or an open wound. From there they enter the bloodstream and inject microscopic amounts of Agent A0-3959X.91-15 into the victim’s white blood cells.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rightcol\" style=\"top:34px\">\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">INFECTION:</strong> Exposure to Neomorphic Motes is handled as a disease with Virulence 9. If the first Sickness Roll fails, the patient enters Stage III within one Shift. No further Sickness Rolls are made. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> Like all insects—alien or otherwise—Neomorphic Mote tend to avoid smoke and are killed by fire</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:1530px\">\n<h2 class=\"heading\">STAGE III: NEOMORPHIC BLOODBURSTER</h2>\n<div class=\"leftcol\">\n<p>Once the Motes enter a host’s bloodstream, they deliver their microscopic payload and die. The injected Agent A0-3959X.91-15 begins to mutate white blood cells as they circulate throughout the body until they form a cancerous growth that becomes lodged in a vein or arterial wall. This tumor can take root in any bodily area of sufficient mass—such as the lungs, the digestive tract, the esophagus, or even the brain. Forming an amniotic sack, the tumor begins rapidly converting the host's own mutated cells into a larval Bloodburster. <br />If lodged in a region of the body with dense muscle or bone and no easy egress, the gestating creature develops dorsal spines to aid in its escape. When the newly formed Bloodburster is ready to be born, it violently removes itself from the host—using its inordinate strength, spines, teeth, and claws to cut and tear through flesh, bone, and sinew. The process causes severe hemorrhaging and massive tissue damage in the host, is always fatal, and results in the birth of a Bloodburster. <br />Bloodbursters have a bulbous head with sharp canines, and run about on all fours. These rabid quadrupedal creatures rely on their speed and agility to avoid damage. Emerging about 0.3 meters in length, Bloodbursters continue to grow exponentially, visibly getting larger as they move about. Highly aggressive, they lash out at anything and everything around them. They use their claws, tail, and teeth to savagely maul their victims.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rightcol\">\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">BIRTH:</strong> A patient entering Stage III is immediately killed outright by the birth of the Bloodburster. The newly born Bloodburster takes one Round to sluggishly free itself from its amniotic sack. As soon as it is free, it flies into a savage rage and attacks any living creature it encounters. See the table of signature attacks to the below. After just a few Turns, the Bloodburster enters Stage IV (juvenile Neomorph). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SPRINT:</strong> As a slow action, the Bloodburster can sprint as if having used two run actions, i.e. through two zones or from an adjacent zone directly into <strong>ENGAGED</strong> range from a target. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> The best bet is to attack a Bloodburster right after birth—before it has sluggishly freed itself from its amniotic sack (above). Fire or any serious damage done to the creature at this time causes it to run off and hide while it rapidly grows to its juvenile form.</p>\n<br />\n<table class=\"stable\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption><strong>TYPICAL STATS <br />NEOMORPHIC BLOODBURSTER </strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"oddcol4\">SPEED:</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"oddcol4\">HEALTH:</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"oddcol4\">SKILLS</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Mobility 9, Observation 6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"oddcol4\">ARMOR RATING</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">3 (zero against fire damage)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:2185px\">\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong> BLOODBURSTER ATTACKS </strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">D6</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">ATTACK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">1-3</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">ESCAPE.

Feral and ferocious, a juvenile Neomorph uses its sharp-tipped tail and teeth to attack.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>TYPICAL STATS <br />Neophyte(Juvenile neomorph) </strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"oddcol4\">SPEED:</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"oddcol4\">HEALTH:</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"oddcol4\">SKILLS</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Mobility 10, Observation 6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"oddcol4\">ARMOR RATING</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">4 (2 against fire damage)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rightcol\">\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">EVOLVING:</strong> After one Shift, the juvenile Neomorph enters Stage V and becomes an adult Neomorph. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SPRINT:</strong> As a slow action, the Neomorph can sprint as if having used two run actions, i.e. through two zones or from an adjacent zone directly into <strong>ENGAGED</strong> range from a target. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> Even when taking weapons fire, a juvenile Neomorph is so focused on the attack that it ignores damage to itself until it becomes critical.

Soon, it assumes a gaunt, bipedal stance, reaching a height of 2.1 meters or more. When the creature’s mouth closes, its jawline is imperceptible, giving it an inquisitive, ethereal appearance. When provoked, the adult Neomorph’s upper jaw protrudes in a manner similar to a goblin shark, allowing it to grasp prey and pull it in for the kill.

The alien shifts from egg to parasitic Facehugger to embryonic Chestburster to adult creature and beyond before beginning the cycle anew. <br /><br />While it has been classified inaccurately as either Invictus raptus or Linguafaeda acheronis by the few in the scientific community to have observed the alien and survived, recent research seems to indicate that Xeno­morph XX121 is actually comprised of two separate species—the Facehugger (Manumala noxhydria) that inseminates a host, and the rapidly maturing Chestburster creature (Plagiarus praepotens) that results from that act—both operating together in a symbiotic relationship. Allegedly blind, the alien still has keen senses and can detect even the slightest movement. <br /><br />These biomechanoid creatures shed their cells and replace them with polarized silicon, essentially growing their own refractive armor. They have highly caustic concentrated acid for blood and deadly prehensile tails. Immensely strong in their adult forms, a Plagiarus Drone or Soldier can easily lift a man by the head and crush his skull in its hands. <br /><br />As to their origins, no one can be certain. Some believe them to be biological weapons created by some bygone race, possibly the enigmatic and godlike Engineers, while others believe they are a naturally evolved species that the Engineers themselves worshipped. Some religious cults take that a step further, believing the aliens were sent here by God or gods to exact divine retribution on humanity for leaving our solar system and daring to enter the heavens. Still others believe that humanity had a hand in the creatures’ creation, and that they are a corporate experiment run amok. <br /><br />What is for certain is that they are dangerous to everyone. <br />They are a parasitic plague that is working its way across the Frontier, and Weyland-Yutani, as well as other corporations, want to find a way to control and weaponize them for profit.</p>\n<br />\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\"><strong>A NOTE FROM MU/TH/UR.</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">It’s important to note that different Xeno­morph XX121 strains have different traits, and that the information provided here is based on the latest xenobiological information. As we study them more and advances in science are made, we will slowly begin to understand these creatures better, supplanting theory with fact.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 class=\"heading\">XENOMORPH XX121</h2>\n<div class=\"leftcol\">\n<p>The special abilities described below are common to all varieties of Xeno­morph XX121. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">ACID SPLASH:</strong> When a Xeno­morph XX121 is wounded some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within <strong>ENGAGED</strong> range. Each type of Xeno­morph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash—hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xeno­morph, and the more damage it has taken, the greater the splash. <br />The strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xeno­morph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each <span class=\"basesymbol\"> </span> rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammo and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring, a ship’s hull, and so on (at GM’s discretion). <br />The acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see <a class=\"content-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-link data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.DKEXiVGcVDmsykhM\" data-id=\"DKEXiVGcVDmsykhM\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">OTHER HAZARDS</a>. However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over. <br />If a victim is Broken by the acid splash, or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a <strong>MEDICAL AID</strong> roll.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rightcol\">\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SPRINT:</strong> All Xeno­morph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions—i.e., through two zones or from an adjacent zone directly into <strong>ENGAGED</strong> range of a target. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">RESISTANCE TO VACUUM:</strong> The resilient physiology of Xeno­morph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space. As such, the Xeno can act indefinitely in such an environment without suffering any ill effects. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">FALLING:</strong> The Xeno­morphs are beautifully adapted for climbing and jumping. As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage. Falling damage taken by a Xeno­morph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">IMMUNE TO THE COLD:</strong> Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xeno­morph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">RADIATION:</strong> Xeno­morph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation. They can suffer 10 Rads before feeling any ill effects—i.e. the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">NO RESPIRATION:</strong> For all intents and purposes, a Xeno­morph does not need to breathe, at least, not in any way that has currently been observed. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">NO HEAT SIGNATURE:</strong> Xeno­morph XX121 does not register on infrared or thermographic sensors.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:3818px\">\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\"><strong>EXAMPLE</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">A Xeno­morph with an Acid Splash rating of 8 takes a huge hit, suffering five points of damage from a Smart Gun on auto-fire.

They come in various sizes from 0.6 to 1.2 meters tall. While most open with four petals at the top, some only have a single slit that opens to reveal the Facehugger it carries within. These eggs are lifeforms in their own right, able to protect their precious cargo from blunt trauma and forced entry, while also sensing movement and awakening the parasite within accordingly. Naturally occurring alien eggs are generated in one of two forms—either they are the result of a transformation perpetrated on a living host, causing it to metamorphose into an Ovomorph, or they are simply birthed by a Queen. Queen produced eggs are hardier and healthier than those produced through ovomorphing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rightcol\">\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">OPENING THE EGG:</strong> If a potential host comes within <strong>ENGAGED</strong> range of an Ovomorph, the host must make a <strong>MOBILITY</strong> roll each Round to not disturb it. If it fails, the egg will open and release a Facehugger. An Ovomorph can release its Facehugger even at <strong>SHORT</strong> range—roll a Stress Dice each Round. On a <span class=\"stresssymbol\"> </span> , the Facehugger is released. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> If you shoot an egg with a rifle, the bullet is likely to deflect off its rubbery hide. Fire is a proven method of sterilizing them, and explosives do the trick as well. Keep in mind that the eggs are essentially vats of acid, and when exploding will cause acid damage accordingly. Extreme cold can make an egg dormant. <br /><br /></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:4217px\">\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>OVOMORPH (EGG)</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"oddcol3\">OVOMORPH (EGG)</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol3\">THE QUEEN’S EGG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">SPEED</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol3\">0</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol3\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">HEALTH</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol3\">2</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol3\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">SKILLS</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol3\">None</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol3\">None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">ARMOR RATING</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol3\">2 (0 Vs Fire)</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol3\">3 (1 Vs Fire)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">ACID SPLASH</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol3\">4</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol3\">5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br /><br />\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\"><strong>OVOMORPHING: WHICH CAME FIRST — THE ALIEN OR THE EGG?</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">When isolated from a hive, a Drone will begin collecting hosts, typically incapacitating them by partially crushing their skulls. It will then cocoon its victims in a secreted saliva resin, introducing a series of enzymes and growth hormones to the hosts in order to transform them into alien eggs. <br />This process is called ovomorphing. Using the developing barb on its bladed tail, the Drone inserts genetic material from M. noxhydria into the host’s eggmorphing body, allowing the newly formed egg to incubate a new Facehugger and thus continuing the alien’s life cycle. If conditions are right, a new Queen will be along in short order. The ovomorphing process typically takes 24–36 hours (four to six Shifts) to complete.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:4210px\">\n<h2 class=\"heading\">STAGE II: FACEHUGGER</h2>\n<div class=\"leftcol\">\n<p>Manumala noxhydria is a parasitic form of Xeno­morph designed for one task only—the implantation of Plagiarus bacteria within a living host. Coming in a variety of sickly yellowish to brown flesh tones, a Facehugger has a small body, eight spider or crab-like fingers, two large breathing sacks, and a long and powerful tail which it uses to spring itself onto a startled host’s face. The Facehugger clutches its fingers around the victim's head, wraps its tail around their throat, and emits an anesthetic that renders the host unconscious, before inserting its proboscis down the creature’s throat. There are several different Facehugger types which appear to vary only slightly in appearance. The major difference is the type of seed they carry—be it for a Praetomorph, Xeno­morph Drone, or Queen. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">FACEHUGGER AND PRAETO-FACEHUGGER:</strong> These typical creatures are described above. The Praeto-Facehugger is slightly bigger than the standard one but otherwise functions the same and is less dexterous. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">ROYAL FACEHUGGER:</strong> The royal variety of Facehugger has eight webbed fingers and is much larger than the standard type. Armored, it also possesses two serrated fingertips and a bladed tail with which to defend itself. Some specimens have also been known to have spikes on their back and spots on their air bladders. While it is theorized that a regular Facehugger can produce a P. praepotens with the ability to transmute into a Queen if necessary, the larger and more powerful Royal Facehuggers are known to specifically produce Queens, and hypothesized to carry not one but two P. praepotens spores—allowing the royal Facehugger to not only produce a Queen, but also a protector for the newborn royalty.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rightcol\">\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">EMBRYO IMPLANTATION:</strong> Weyland-Yutani surgical scientist Dr. Matshuita believes that a Facehugger deposits a Chestburster embryo within its victim, making them the same species. Others believe what is deposited to be a cancerous growth that mutates and transforms into a Chestburster, while former W-Y geneticist Dr. Blue Grace Marsalis hypothesized a controversial third theory. Dr. Marsalis believes there is a symbiotic relationship between the Facehugger and the Chestburster, calling the former Manumala noxhydria and the later P. praepotens. She postulated that it is neither an embryo nor an implanted cancer, but an injected bacteria that is the beginnings of P. praepotens. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">FACEHUGGING:</strong> The Stage II Xeno will automatically facehug any immobilized potential host within <strong>ENGAGED</strong> range. In combat, a successful signature attack #6 will do the trick. If the victim is facehugged, the Xeno­morph infects its host via its proboscis, inseminating them deep within their chest cavity. There the host’s own cells mutate to form and incubate the Xeno­morph until its next stage. The victim is rendered unconscious. Within one Shift, the Facehugger dies and falls off. The victim wakes up, typically very hungry. After another Shift has passed, a Chestburster (Stage III) is born, killing the host. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> A Facehugger is incredibly fast and strong for its size, and in most cases it cannot be removed from a host’s face without killing the host itself. While its polarized silicon skin protects it from most forms of melee attack, it is helpless against pulse rounds and laser tools. Again, fire works wonders.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:4952px\">\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>FACEHUGGER</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">FACEHUGGER</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">PRAETO-FACEHUGGER</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">ROYAL FACEHUGGER</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">SPEED</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">2</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">2</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">HEALTH</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">2</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">2</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">SKILLS</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">MOBILITY</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">8</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">6</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">OBSERVATION</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">8</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">8</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">ARMOR RATING</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">2 (0 Vs Fire)</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">2 (0 Vs Fire)</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">4 (4 Vs Fire)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">ACID SPLASH</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">4</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">4</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br /><br />\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>FACEHUGGER ATTACKS</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">D6</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">ATTACK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">1</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">HORRIBLE ROAR.

While most hosts feel sick to their stomach as the parasite grows within them, some comment that they feel better than they have in ages. As the organs of the host are transformed into the embryonic alien, the host’s ribcage is also softened to a point where the Chestburster can perform the act after which it is named. Gestation complete, the creature erupts from the host, killing it from a combination of massive tissue damage, blood loss, and organ transformation. A newly birthed alien exhibits different traits depending on its type. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CHESTBURSTER:</strong> Jaundiced beige in color, the snake-like Chestburster has a mouth full of metallic canines. Depending on the length of gestation, a Chestburster will either be born with tiny arms or stubs where the arms will eventually grow in. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">BAMBI BURSTER:</strong> Otherwise similar to the Chestburster, this fawn-like creature is the result of an alien embryo developing within a quadrupedal host. As animals generally mature at a faster rate than humans, the Bambi-burster is birthed with four spindly legs that it uses to propel itself at great speeds. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">IMP:</strong> The immature form of a Praetomorph, the Imp has translucent skin, a carapace and rawboned features that make it look very much like a miniature version of its adult form. If an Imp doesn’t feel threatened upon emergence, it will sometimes mimic the actions of the nearest creature. Like all Praetomorph stages, Imps mature at a substantially faster rate than traditional Chestbursters.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rightcol\">\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">QUEENBURSTER:</strong> An embryonic queen, the Stage III Xeno­morph nicknamed the Queenburster gestates over days instead of hours. When born, the creature has a partially formed crest on its head, both sets of arms, and fully developed legs. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">BIRTH:</strong> The birth of the Chestburster kills the host outright. The Chestburster has evolved to make a shocking display immediately after birth as a defense mechanism: it snarls, hisses and squeals whilst spraying the blood of its host in all directions. People who witness this for the first time must make an immediate Panic Roll. Within one Shift, the Chestburster evolves to Stage IV. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> Surgical attempts to remove an embryonic Chestburster to date have resulted in the death of the patient—and depending on how far along it is into the gestation period—the death of the alien as well. Despite being able to defend itself, at this stage the Xeno­morph is at its most vulnerable. It is easily killed by gunshots, explosives, knives, and fire—if it can be caught. Once birthed it will immediately seek both a place to hide and a source of raw metals to consume in order to complete the transformation into an adult—in addition to organic foods, aliens eat metals to increase their mass.

Their now fully polarized skin is near black in tone; they have a bladed prehensile tail, six-fingered hands with enlarged nails, pronounced ribs, and translucent to opaque smooth-domed heads. In addition to their metallic, toothy mouths, they have an inner set of jaws that can strike like a piston—a favored mode of attack. <br />Save for the Scout, Stage IV Xeno­morphs have four dorsal tubes affixed to their backs. While some have theorized the tubes are used for spinning and cocooning the resin for their hive, that has generally been discounted as a fallacy. The current line of thinking is that the tubes are a type of breathing apparatus, filtering out airborne toxins and allowing the creatures to breath underwater. However, as Aliens have been observed surviving in the vacuum of space, it is possible that they do not need to breathe at all. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">STALKER:</strong> Averaging about 2.7 meters tall and comfortable moving on two legs as well as all four, Stalkers are the highly aggressive adult form of the Praetomorph. Classified as Plagiarus linesteres, the Praetomorph is a variant breed of Xeno­morph XX121. The Stalker is believed to be an evolutionary dead end for the Praetomorph, as no encountered specimen has ever metamorphosed further. Unlike its phylogenetic relative P. praepotens, the P. linesteres does not appear to have a Queen stage. It also differs in that it has no biomechanical endoskeleton, and its teeth are translucent bone instead of metal. They are bigger, more powerful, resilient, and more resistant to fire than standard Xenos—they just happen to be less intelligent and more animalistic in nature. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SCOUT:</strong> 2.1 meters tall when standing upright, the brown-black Scout or Runner is a particularly fast adaptation of P. praepotens. Usually moving about on all fours, the Scout’s job is to seek out a nearby source of hosts and alert the hive when one is found. If no hive yet exists, the scout will begin capturing hosts and cocooning them for ovomorphing until a Queenburster is produced. Once the Queen is birthed and a hive location is secure, a Scout will metamorphose to its next stage. For reasons unknown, Scouts have no dorsal tubes — they do not develop them until Stage V.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rightcol\">\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">DRONE:</strong> Sometimes called Lurkers, Drones stand 2.4 meters tall, and are stealthy ambush hunters. Their tails end in a deadly hooked blade and rudimentary barb for Ovomorph injection. In many ways, Drones are the most alien of the species. It is theorized that the strange behavior often exhibited by Drones is due to them reaching young adulthood without establishing a connection to the alien hive mind. The stealthy creatures’ fluid yet awkward movements and unorthodox reactions to stimuli belie their methodical intelligence. As much as a Stalker acts like a feral animal, a Drone plots. The ebon Drone is a clever yet single-minded iteration of the Xeno­morph. Development of P. praepotens will arrest at Stage IV unless a Queen’s pheromones cause it to molt into a Worker or Soldier—whichever form the hive is most in need of. Until then it will eat, gather hosts for ovomorphing, and sleep. When it evolves to the next stage, it joins the hive mind. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SILENT ASSASSIN [DRONE ONLY]:</strong> When making a stealth mode roll or sneak attack from within the same zone, the Drone is so silent that its target gets a –2 modification to their <strong>OBSERVATION</strong> test. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">FERAL HUNGER [STALKER ONLY]:</strong> The Stalker has an insatiable need to kill. If it makes an attack that causes damage it will immediately make a second attack (with eight Base Dice, Damage 1) against the same target as a free action. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> Stage IV Xenos are notoriously difficult to kill. They operate outside of the alien hive mind and are independent—but each exhibits traits that can be exploited. Stalkers and Scouts can be tricked into running into a hazardous situation. Drones are a bit smarter, but they follow a routine and spend most of their time hibernating in warm places such as somewhere close to a reactor core—and can be hunted down accordingly.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:6754px\">\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>STALKER, SCOUT, DRONE</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">Stalker</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">Scout</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">Drone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">SPEED</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">2</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">3</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">HEALTH</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">6</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">5</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">SKILLS</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">MOBILITY</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">OBSERVATION</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">6</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">10</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">ARMOR RATING</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">10 (5 Vs Fire)</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8 (4 Vs Fire)</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8 (4 Vs Fire)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">ACID SPLASH</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>STALKER, SCOUT &amp; DRONE ATTACKS</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">D6</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">ATTACK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">1</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">HYPNOTIZING GAZE: The Xeno­morph, eyeless as it may seem, stares deeply into the soul of its victim.

As the alien matures, the creature’s dome loses its form and melds with the ridged tissues beneath it. The alien’s head begins to polarize and harden, forming an armored carapace. Blades will begin to grow from the Xeno’s elbows, and its hands will mutate into five-fingered claws, dropping the sixth digit. Blue-black in color, Soldiers are nimble and attack en masse. The Soldier’s tail has a barb at the end with a toxin that can cause paralysis in most known lifeforms. Once incapacitated, the Soldier will carry its prey back to the hive to be impregnated by a Facehugger. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">WORKER:</strong> The diminutive Workers build and maintain the hive. Also called Weavers, they produce and spin the resin of the hive with their long proboscis tongues, shape it with their hands and feet, position eggs near cocooned hosts, and feed and maintain the Queen. Physically, they are somewhat different than the other members of P. praepotens. Transformation from Drone to Worker will see an alien shrink to between 1.2 and 1.8 meters in height. Its skin will turn a sickly grayish white, while its tongue grows pink, elongates, and develops a funnel through which it will secrete the makings of the hive. Workers ignore threats within the hive and will run if threatened, leaving their protection to Soldiers and Sentries.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rightcol\">\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SENTRY:</strong> After Scouts have secured a hive and a source of hosts, they mature into Sentries. Like Soldiers, their carapaces become ridged and armored. They are still incredibly fast and dexterous, with specialized gripping hands and feet that allow them to scale walls and ceilings with greater efficiency than other Xenos. Attuned to their Queen’s needs, they will back off or attack as she signals. Also called Defenders, Sentries will not hesitate to sacrifice themselves to keep hive invaders at bay and protect their Queen. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> As always, fire keeps Xeno­morphs at bay. The non-aggressive Workers are easy to take down as they offer little resistance. A Soldier’s carapace is armored enough to shrug off regular ammunition rounds, but pulse rifles make short work of them. Soldiers tend to work in groups, overwhelming targets with sheer numbers. Because of this, it is possible to take out a large number of them with an area effect weapon, hopefully evening the odds a bit. Sentries will not leave the inner hive unless the Queen does, so stay out of there and you’ll easily avoid them. You know what? Just stay out of an alien hive.

Their immense size and crested carapaces mark them as the leaders of their hive. Stronger and smarter than those beneath them, Stage VI Xenos command alien armies. These Stages are only reached when an existing Queen produces royal jelly and exposes her Soldiers and Sentries to it. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">PRAETORIAN:</strong> When a hive reaches a population of over 300 individuals, Workers feed the Queen’s chosen warriors with Royal Jelly until the transformation to Praetorian takes place. The penultimate form of an alien Soldier, Praetorians grow up to twice the height of their brethren. They develop a head crest similar to a Queen’s, but maintain a more standardized bipedal form with only two arms. Lead protectors of the hive, Praetorians are the Queen’s Royal Guards and army commanders. It is theorized that if a hive loses its Queen, a Praetorian can molt into a new one. If this happened before another hive invaded, the old hive can be preserved. If not, the invaders take advantage of the leaderless Xenos and claims them for their own Queen. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CHARGER:</strong> Also called the Crusher, the Charger is the Xeno­morph equivalent of a tank. After being force-fed Royal Jelly and raw metals by the Queen’s workers for weeks, a bloated Sentry will cocoon itself in resin and undergo a massive transformation. Its quadrupedal stance is bulked up and its head grows a massive, armored chitinous crest similar to a Queen’s. Chargers grow to stand between 1.8 and 3 meters tall at the shoulder. Heavy defensive protectors of the hive, the Crusher will charge an enemy like a rabid rhino, trampling personnel and plowing through even lightly armored vehicles. Essentially the Runner variant of the Praetorian, the Charger’s mobility is limited in that it cannot climb or jump very well. Luckily, they are relatively rare and only appear in long established hives</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rightcol\">\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">QUEEN:</strong> The mother of the hive, at six meters tall or more, the alien Queen is perhaps the strongest and most intelligent of the species. While any adult alien is capable of initiating ovomorphing in a host organism, only Queens have the ability to lay eggs en masse. When her first molt is completed and the Queen is fertile, her Workers spin a resin cradle that holds her suspended above the floor of the hive. The Queen then grows an enormous egg sac that soon becomes distended and engorged with developing eggs. As each new Ovomorph is ready, she deposits it on the ground via ovipositor for her Workers to spirit away to nearby cocooned hosts. <br />The most astonishing thing about the Queen is her ability to communicate with her hive. While evidence exists to suggest she does so via a combination of pheromones and subsonic vocalizations, there are company consultants who believe she communicates telepathically as well, “speaking” with her children over immeasurable distances. In fact, corporate psychiatrists have documented that employees who score high on their company esper tests and find themselves within the proximity of an alien hive will have vivid dreams of the Queen calling to them, whether they are aware of her existence or not. <br />Additionally, professional dreamers seem to have a hard time producing after being exposed to an alien Queen. Of course, this could simply be a form of PTSD, but it bears further investigation. An alien Queen’s distinguishing characteristics include her size, her large crested head, set of six dorsal spikes (instead of tubes), unique stance and a second set of grasping arms. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> A Charger is nigh invulnerable while charging with its head shield down, but its body is only as armored as that of a regular alien Soldier, and well-placed explosives or heavy artillery will make short work of the beast. While they have few weaknesses, taking out a Praetorian will temporarily disorient the Soldiers it coordinates. As for dealing with the Queen… yeah.

It has been suggested that a Queen will continue to grow as her hive does, reaching Tyrannosaurus rex proportions in Empress and Queen Mother stages that rule over several Queens and several hives. There are reports of Praetorians molting into something called Palantines, and rumors of a so called Alien King, but so far reports of such transformations are unsubstantiated and only hypothetical. What will be found next on the Frontier is anyone’s guess.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rightcol\">\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\"><strong>OTHER XENOMORPH TYPES</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">As has been implied, there are things out there we do not understand. Engineer murals depict horrifying monstrosities, the likes of which we have yet to encounter on the Frontier. They may simply be mythological, or they may be real. There are reports of xenocobras and large squid-like starfish creatures, as well as an alien that appears to be a missing link between a Neomorph and Xeno­morph XX121—a dark blue, goblin-jawed Xeno lovingly dubbed the Deacon (because of its pointed head). Whatever is out there, just pray you don’t run into it in the dark.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:8764px\">\n<h2 class=\"heading\">THE ALIEN HIVE</h2>\n<div class=\"leftcol\">\n<p>An alien hive is a large Xeno­morph XX121 nest, composed mainly of secreted resin, that is either built into an existing structure or free standing on its own. Hives are full of twisting and confusing biomechanical tunnels and corridors that have been spun and crafted by Worker aliens. The damp, muted green-gray walls make it easier for P. praepotens to climb and maneuver, and are full of ridges and pockets for alien Soldiers to hide in. The sticky walls also serve another purpose—hosts are cocooned and impregnated within them until they birth a Chestburster and are killed. The hosts’ decaying bodies then grows into the resin, serving as nourishment for the Workers and Soldiers of the hive. The atmosphere inside the hive is usually hot, dank and humid, and the putrid smell is unbearable. Soldiers lay dormant, hibernating in the walls and on the ceiling until called to task by their Queen.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rightcol\">\n<p>Along the way there are many small chambers that serve unknown purposes, and deep within the nest’s maze is a centralized and guarded chamber where the Queen sits atop a bloated egg sac and deposits her eggs. Some hives have been found to contain diluted derivative pools of Chemical A0-3959X.91-15, likely secreted by the Xeno­morphs themselves and used to perform genetic alterations on hosts in order to make them more suitable for the production of the type of Chestbursters the hive needs most. It’s a nasty place and one you should avoid.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aframe\" style=\"top:9140px\">\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\"><strong>SPECIES INTERACTION: <br />WHY CAN’T WE ALL JUST GET ALONG?</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">Let’s face it—there is no love lost on the Frontier. <br />Aliens hate humans, and just like humans, they mostly hate each other as well. <br />Creatures of different types generally don't get along. <br />Sure, a Facehugger and a Xeno­morph Soldier will work together, but a Xeno­morph Soldier and a Neomorph will go for each other's throats. <br />Feral Neomorphs will attack anything living not of their type—they find androids a curiosity and will only attack them if provoked. <br />Xeno­morph XX121s are similar, attacking any creature they perceive to be a threat. <br />Abominations hate anyone and everyone until they reach maturity—then they begin to settle and tolerate each other’s presence (but still dislike humans, androids, and other aliens). <br />Praetomorphs, on the other hand, simply will not tolerate any other alien species. <br />Xeno­morphs from different hives will clash with the intention of killing each other’s Queen. When one hive kills the Queen of another, the leaderless hive is absorbed by the victor. The previous Queen’s eggs and Praetorians are destroyed, while Scouts, Workers, and Drones are immediately assimilated. <br />The Soldiers are another story. <br />While a reigning Queen releases pheromones that bind the new Soldiers to her, many times she will simply have them destroyed as well.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br /><br /></div>\n</div>",

<p>\n        A colony may owe an overall allegiance to a corporation or nation, depending on its location. In the Union of Progressive Peoples, the allegiance of a colony is always to the UPP itself.\n        In the Independent Core System Colonies (ICSC), although colonies are technically independent, in reality each is heavily dominated by a corporation with interests there.\n        Colonies within the American and the Anglo-Japanese Arms have strong allegiances either to the governing power in that part of space, or to a corporation with strong business interests on the planet.\n        For colonies outside of the UPP, roll randomly for an allegiance, choose one, or create your own.\n    </p>\n

While independent from each other, member colonies sell and trade resources and pay fees to be protected by corporate armed forces. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The corporate owned Central Space Consortium of the ICSC is seen as a haven for those on the run from their government. If someone with a skill set useful to a corporate colony comes seeking asylum within the CSC, the Consortium will usually buy off that person’s tribunal and make them an indentured citizen. In this way, corporations bolster their private mercenary forces and spy networks with the best of the worst elements of society.</span>  </p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">H I S T O R Y</span></h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> Once known as the CSC, or Central Space Consortium, this sector was first formed in the 2080s by corporations looking for a way to avoid paying taxes to their earthbound governments. Establishing major holdings on off-world colonies, these corporations declared their independence and created their own laws. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Companies like Weyland-Yutani, Seegson, Chigusa, Hyperdyne, and the Jĭngtì Lóng Corporation all have planetary holdings in the CSC. As humanity’s reach stretched into the Outer Rim during the 2100s, more and more UA and 3WE colonies became dissatisfied with the support they received from their governments. Colonial administration was understaffed and overworked. Supply lines were late and the marines and marshals were spread too thin. Some colonies decided to declare themselves independent, but with no corporate giant behind them, they soon found themselves easy prey for pirates and government reclamation. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">In the spirit of free commerce, the Consortium reinvented themselves as the Independent Core System Colonies and extended their reach past the core systems to offer support to any colony that wanted its freedom—and could afford to pay the CSC’s protection fees. Because the ICSC is outside of any governmental jurisdiction, individual planets set up their own rules. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Several large banks and credit companies have settled here, providing security and bonds for corporations whose shady dealings might otherwise have their accounts frozen for government investigation.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">L E A D E R S</span></h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The ICSC is run by the Central Space Consortium, a board of directors representing each major corporation and one director representing the member colonies outside of the core systems. The director’s office sends a representative (<a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.qljqTQwzeeOjstz8.JournalEntryPage.x1OYdcdrsfdGfKQW\" data-id=\"x1OYdcdrsfdGfKQW\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">MARTIN</a>) to tour the independent colonies, getting a feel for what those lone worlds need from the alliance, as well as what they can supply in return.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">L O C A T I O N S</span> </span></h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> The ICSC is clustered in the Core, in one of the richest resource-filled areas of the known galaxy—New Eden Sector. Key systems here include Volcus, Ventix, Grendel, and the colonies of Alexandria, Exeter, and St. John.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">R E L A T I O N S</span></h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> Both the 3WE and the UA have imposed trade sanctions and severe import and export taxes on the ICSC. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">A major USCMC base is located just outside the ICSC—in part to keep a watchful eye on the independent systems, but also because Weyland-Yutani wants the Colonial Marines close in case of an invasion of the ICSC by the UPP. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Even though they are separate from the major governments, the Consortium has contracts in place to use national military forces for added protection. Outside the Core, the ICSC services, protects, and trades with a smattering of independent worlds in the Outer Rim and on the Frontier, including the Solomons and Anchorpoint Station.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">M I L I T A R Y</span></h2>\n    <p>The ICSC operates a combined security fleet of mercenary operatives from each of the corporate members. As can be guessed, while they are deadly when operating in small units, they are disastrous at fleet maneuvers and coordinated defenses simply because they do not possess the same training or follow the same rules of engagement.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">C U R R E N T  A C T I V I T I E S</span></h2>\n    <p>While corporations are cutthroat out in “the real world,” they are forced to play nice with each other within the boundaries of the ICSC. Together they operate a massive smuggling ring and black market operation.</p>\n    <p>Opportunities abound for starship crews willing to do a quiet run from New Eden to the Frontier and back. Because of this, ICC agents and Colonial Marshals have their hands full policing the sector’s imports and exports. The Consortium has also been covertly sending recruiters to successful colonies in an attempt to convince them to leave their government and join the ICSC.</p>\n    <p>This practice is illegal and Colonial Administration is monitoring the situation closely.</p>\n    <p>The Interstellar Commerce Commission is an organization designed to monitor and conduct interstellar trade. They enforce shipping restrictions and biological and chemical quarantine procedures for Earth and all other colonies with a population of 200,000 or more.</p>\n    <p>In addition to performing spacedock inspections, the ICC can randomly detain, seize, and search cargo and personal craft for suspected contraband.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n</div>",

It is about confronting your deepest fears, fighting them and trying to get home in one piece.\n    It is about horror.\n    The iconic Xenomorph is the ultimate manifestation of this aspect, but the universe is capable of creating horror in lots of different ways and not all are alien in nature.\n    Unethical corporate experiments, bloody conflicts, and violent natural disasters make living in 2183 a tough proposition.\n    The original <i>Alien</i> movie from 1979 is the perfect example of a space horror story.\n    <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SPACE IS HELL:</strong> Nature is neither good nor evil.\n    It is, however, indifferent to humanity.\n    The universe is a harsh place to live in and will kill you in the blink of an eye if given a chance.\n    A routine space walk, a sudden solar flare, or an ice storm can go from something serene or even beautiful to life-threatening in a second.\n    <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">KILLING GREED:</strong> ALIEN focuses on blue-collar workers at the bottom of the economic ladder.\n    The ordinary working men and women struggling to get by in a brutal, hyper-capitalistic society are the real heroes of the stories.\n    It’s working class sci-fi, where your sympathies are meant to be given to the little people.\n    The greedy corporations and power hungry nations are the dragons which the PCs will have to face, sooner or later.\n    In the end, humans are often the biggest monsters.\n  </p>\n  <br />\n  <h2 class=\"heading\">SCI-FI ACTION</h2>\n  <p>\n    Big set pieces, powerful weapons, and frenzied combat scenes.\n    Action is a powerful driver in the ALIEN universe, whether it comes in the form of the colonial marines sweeping a seemingly abandoned mine only to discover something lurking in the dark, mighty starships exchanging missile volleys in high orbit, or corporate agents infiltrating an enemy installation.\n    Heart-pounding action is a core element in the ALIEN roleplaying game.\n    James Cameron’s <i>Aliens</i> from 1986 is the seminal action movie in the series.\n    <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SOMEONE ELSE’S WAR:</strong> The conflicts and wars of the 22nd century are all about the big corps or big nations wanting to get bigger.\n    They are about power and money for the ones that already have too much.\n    The little people are the ones actually doing the fighting and you can be damn sure that the war is not really about their needs.\n    Soldiers, marines, and grunts are all working for the Man.\n    They fight because they need the paycheck to survive, not for some idealistic cause.\n    <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">EXPENDABLE ASSETS:</strong> Being a soldier in 2183 is being a very small cog in a very big machine.\n    A soldier is entirely expendable.\n    There is no shortage of poor young men and women that are willing to fill the ranks.\n    Serving in the military means being at the mercy of the top brass and their corporate overlords.\n    Human life is not a valuable commodity, better get used to it.\n  </p>\n  <br />\n\n  <h2 class=\"heading\">SENSE OF WONDER</h2>\n  <p>\n    The ALIEN universe is a place of long-lost secrets and ancient mysteries.\n    Faraway colonists report strange findings, spaceship crews on the Frontier discover inexplicable signals and encounter things that defy classification.\n    There is clearly more to the universe than previously thought.\n    The realization that the universe is not an empty place is an important aspect of ALIEN stories.\n    The first act of the original <i>Alien</i> movie by Ridley Scott is about finding the unthinkable.\n    A similar theme is present in <i>Prometheus</i>.\n    <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">THE ORIGIN OF LIFE:</strong> Where do we come from, who made us, what are we here for?\n    These questions are as old as humanity itself.\n    Nevertheless, these existential thoughts are made all the more relevant once humans encounter life amongst the stars.\n    Birth, death, and the cycle of life is an important theme of many stories in ALIEN.\n    <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">OLD AND NEW GODS:</strong> With science struggling to answer the question of alien life and our role in the universe, religion answers the call.\n    When humanity stares into the dark abyss of space and sees death and horror, many turn back towards faith and worship.\n  </p>\n  <br /><br />\n  <table class=\"ntable\">\n    <caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n      <b>RETRO FUTURISM</b>\n    </caption>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n          The future is old and worn. Spaceships look like oil refineries, computers are the size of a room, space suits look like they belong to 19th Century divers. <br />\n          Everything in the ALIEN universe is designed for practicality and durability. <br />\n          The retro futuristic aesthetic is everywhere, with the possible exception of the dwellings of the corporate elite.\n          This particular brand of retro futurism is the result of Ron Cobb, Ridley Scott, and others who designed the original Alien movie. <br />\n          Use this to describe the universe of ALIEN to the players.\n          Describe old flickering CRT screens, analogue gear, and chunky equipment.\n          Imagine a science fiction world with technology from the 1970’s, leaky pipes, and bad lightning and you’re on point.\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n\n</div>",

An economic and political giant in both the Sol system and throughout the offworld colonies, the military might of the UA is unparalleled.</span>  </p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">H I S T O R Y</span></h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> Created to counter the financial and political might of the newly formed Three World Empire, The United Americas emerged in 2104 as a union of the nations of North, Central, and South America into one socioeconomic block. This alliance allowed the Americas to catch up to the 3WE and become pioneers of space travel and extrasolar colonies in their own right. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The Washington Treaty played a pivotal role in the merger, defining the member states’ responsibilities to the union and outlining provisions for military action performed under the flag of the United Americas. The United States of America stood at the forefront of the newly formed nation, its preexisting scientific and military industrial complex paving the way for the United States Colonial Marine Corps to become humanity’s premiere peacekeeping force throughout the colonies.</span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> When the United Americas was formed, there were already several off-world colonies settled by its member states before the union—and not all of these worlds were happy to be part of this new, all-encompassing government. Torin Prime was one of them. Refusing to acknowledge the authority of the UA, a terrorist rebel faction calling themselves the J’Har seized the colony, murdered planetside officials, and killed or imprisoned anyone not loyal to their cause. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Fearful that other colonies would follow suite, the UA was left with no choice but to make an example of Torin Prime. As the J’Har rounded up more than half the population and interred them in concentration camps, the newly formed United Americas Allied Command (UAAC) worked with counter insurgents planetside to retake the world. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">When the J’Har managed to gain control of a flotilla of warships, the Outer Rim Defense Fleet responded in kind. The civil war escalated into a larger space war and took two years to resolve, but in the process the UA cemented their standing as a powerful nation amongst the stars.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">L E A D E R S</span></h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The United Americas is essentially an extension of the government of the United States of America, and as such is run by a President, Vice President, and a Congress representing all member signatories. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">On the Frontier, any encounter with UA leadership is likely to be with a Colonial Marshal, a bureaucrat from Colonial Administration, or a commander of the Colonial Marines.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">L O C A T I O N S</span> </span></h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> As the nations that later became the 3WE pioneered humanity's expansion into the core systems and Outer Veil, most of the colonies of the United Americas occupy a vast area of the Outer Rim Territories called the American Arm. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The UA Allied Command operates military bases and stations throughout all the territories and additional colonies are laced along the Frontier. Key worlds include Bracken’s World, Terraform 3, Morning Glory, and the Crestus Garrison Systems.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">R E L A T I O N S</span></h2>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> The United Americas and the Union of Progressive Peoples (UPP) have been in a state of cold war for decades. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">While the Colonial Marines are in place to keep the peace for the colonies of the American Arm, contracts and treaties with the 3WE and the Independent Core System Colonies mean that they are also obligated to protect their worlds as well. </span></p>\n    <p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">While the USCMC is not controlled by Weyland-Yutani, the company’s business holdings with the United Americas Allied Command means that the Colonial Marines can be called upon to provide security to W-Y assets at any time—a fact that doesn't sit well with many a platoon commander.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">M I L I T A R Y AND O R G A N I Z A T I O N S</span></h2>\n    <h3><strong>UNITED AMERICAS ALLIED COMMAND:</strong></h3>\n    <p>The UAAC is the joint command of military forces of all members of the United Americas. It is comprised of the United States Colonial Marine Corps (USCMC), the Canadian Colonial Armed Forces (CCAF), the Latin American Colonial Navy (LACN), The United States AeroSpace Force (USASF), and the United Americas Outer Rim Defense Fleet (UAORDF). Headed by the Secretary of Defense, the allied command is a think tank of high level admirals and generals who devise strategy for, and coordinate, all major combat operations.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h3><strong>THE UNITED STATES COLONIAL MARINE CORPS:</strong></h3>\n    <p>Founded before the United Americas merger, the primary focus of the USCMC is to maintain the security of all UA member states and extrasolar colonies. The USCMC spearheads all military campaigns undertaken by the United Americas Allied Command. They maintain several bases across the territories and are stationed at all UA garrisons, placing them within striking distance of nearly any hot spot.</p>\n    <p>While they often operate in tandem with the Aerospace Force and Outer Rim Defense Fleet, they operate their own fleet of frigates and troop transports. At a constant state of readiness, the USCMC has the technology and training to deploy troops at a moment’s notice and operate an independent unit for extended periods in hostile environments without any support.</p>\n    <p>Throughout the eight decades since its inception, the USCMC has engaged in armed conflicts on nearly thirty extrasolar worlds. They have fought rogue nations and rebel colonies, as well as faced off against foreign powers in border and resource disputes. They have provided humanitarian aid in natural disasters, protected civilians in terrorist and hostage crises, and secured colonies from hostile lifeforms.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h3><strong> COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION:</strong></h3>\n    <p>This UA division was formed to protect the rights of all off-world colonists. CA supports and monitors all UA extrasolar colonies and stations and makes sure that supply chains flow as intended, vaccines are distributed, and that a semblance of order is maintained. For decades they have fought to have a minimum wage established for colonists, only to have their efforts blocked by corporate lobbyists.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h3><strong>COLONIAL MARSHAL BUREAU: </strong></h3>\n    <p>The law enforcement arm of the Colonial Administration is the Colonial Marshal Bureau, which maintains police offices throughout the colonies and works with the Interstellar Commerce Commission to prevent the import or export of dangerous biologicals and chemicals. All major Marshal offices have an Interstellar Commerce Commission (ICC) agent attached to them. The Marshals also often work in conjunction with UA Federal agencies.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2 class=\"heading\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">C U R R E N T  A C T I V I T I E S</span></h2>\n    <p>The United Americas has engaged in increased border conflicts with the UPP over disputed worlds.

I ordered her to realign the communications array so I could send a follow-up message to Anchorpoint,\n      but she claimed there was a mechanical error. We tried to go extravehicular to position the array manually but now Mother won’t even open the airlocks. Either she’s been damaged by the reactor\n      build-up or someone’s tampered with her programming. Either way, we’re fucked.\n    </i>\n  </p>\n  <br />\n\n  <p>\n    No matter if you play cinematic or campaign play, any game of ALIEN is based on three key themes. <br />\n    Most scenarios and campaigns contain a mix of these themes, but each scenario typically emphasizes one theme more than the others.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"heading\">SPACE HORROR</h2>\n  <p>\n    The ALIEN experience is rooted in a pervasive darkness and tension, with a capacity to shock by tapping into our primal fears. Every desperate breath into the rebreather of your space suit may\n    be your last.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"heading\">SCI-FI ACTION</h2>\n  <p>\n    Whether it's on an intimate or sprawling scale, roller coaster action - often with bloody results - is essential to many ALIEN stories. This game includes robust mechanics designed for fast and\n    brutal combat.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"heading\">SENSE OF WONDER</h2>\n  <p>\n    The ALIEN roleplaying game lets you discover strange worlds and ancient, incomprehensible artifacts on a grand scale. Many ALIEN stories grapple with questions of humanity's creation, destiny,\n    and place in the universe.\n  </p>\n</div>",

Without the protection of a space suit or the hull of a ship, you won’t last long in the black void. If your ship suffers explosive decompression\n          (below) or if you are thrown out of an airlock, your life is in extreme danger. The absence of pressure creates gas bubbles in your blood, causing your whole body to swell up. This results\n          in crippling pain, all while the raw UV radiation from the nearest star sears your skin. You can’t hold your breath—if you do, your lungs collapse. After that, you are just moments away\n          from death. <br />\n          You must make a <b>STAMINA</b> roll every Round without protection in a vacuum. The test doesn’t require an action, but you must roll it before doing anything else in the round. The roll\n          is unmodified for the first Round, but you get a –1 modification for the second Round. In the third Round you get –2, and so on. A failed roll means you drop directly to zero Health and\n          must make a Death Roll every Round until you die or you enter a pressurized area. You don't suffer a critical injury. <br />\n          Before going unconscious, you should put all your efforts towards getting a space suit on, if one can be found nearby. Climbing into a space suit quickly (a single slow action) requires a\n          successful <b>MOBILITY</b> roll. <br /><br />\n          <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">EXPLOSIVE DECOMPRESSION:</strong> <br /> Firing guns inside a spacecraft is very dangerous. If a shot misses its target in a room next to an outer bulkhead, the\n          weapon will inflict its base Damage rating on the bulkhead instead. Roll for the Armor Rating of the bulkhead (a typical civilian ship has Armor Rating 6). <br />\n          If the armor roll fails to stop the shot, it will penetrate the bulkhead, which means bad news for everyone. The air in the room will vent out into space in a Turn, and the intense draft\n          will require everyone to make a <b>STAMINA</b> roll to perform any action (the <b>STAMINA</b> roll itself counts as a fast action). <br />\n          Most ships will automatically seal off a breached compartment.

You also need a ranged weapon, even if it’s simply something to throw. The\n    weapons tables in the Gear Chapter describe a variety of firearms and other ranged weapons. To draw a gun from a belt or holster, or a rifle from its sling, is a fast action. Firing a weapon is a slow\n    action. <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">AIMING:</strong> If you take your time to aim carefully before squeezing the trigger, you get a +2 to your attack roll. Aiming is a fast action. If you do\n    anything else except shoot your weapon after you have aimed, or if you are hurt, you lose the effect of the aim and you need to spend another fast action to aim again. <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">RANGE:</strong> The weapons tables in the Gear Chapter indicate the range of each weapon, i.e. the maximum range category at which the weapon can be used. The farther\n    away your target is, the harder it is to hit. At Medium range you get a −1 modification, and at LONG range you get −2. At Engaged range you get −3, because it’s hard to draw a bead on an\n    opponent that close. You don’t get this penalty if you fire at a defenseless or unwitting enemy—instead, you get a +3 modification. <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">TARGET SIZE:</strong> Firing at a large target, such as a vehicle, gives a +2 modification to the attack. Firing at a small object, such as a small hatch, a\n    hand-held item, or a Chestburster, gives a –2 modification.\n  </p>\n  <br />\n  <table class=\"ntable\">\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"trhead\">\n          <h2 class=\"heading\">RESOLUTION</h2>\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"trhead\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr class=\"tr2\">\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol2\">\n          If your attack hits, you inflict damage equal to the weapon’s Damage rating on your opponent.

The enemy is not allowed to change their attack after your overwatch attack. <br />\n          Firing when in overwatch position counts as a normal attack (a slow action). Therefore, you must save your slow action in the Round for any overwatch attack you want to make.

Human life is cheap and so are paychecks. There is always someone worse off, willing to do your job for even less, so you better not screw up and lose the one you\n    have. In most professions, having dirt on your employer or becoming a certified expert in a field are the only ways to maintain any semblance of job security. <br /><br />\n    Aside from the luxury accommodations of the corporate elite and the cutting edge weapons of the Colonial Marines, almost everything is grimy, used, and in need of repair. The only colonists\n    guaranteed to receive new parts and equipment are the miners and atmospheric processor support personnel on planets consistently exceeding their corporate quotas. In remote sectors, imported\n    technologies are overpriced and hard to come by, so most equipment is jury-rigged, modified, and made from recycled and refurbished materials. In some territories, vehicles and starships are still\n    in use that are nearly a century old. <br /><br />\n    Instead of the expensive, three dimensional holographic displays of yesteryear, most spacecraft are equipped with conventional monitors and basic sensor packages. <br /><br />\n    Over the past several decades, MU/TH/UR computer systems have become less about the sophistication of the AI and more focused on utilitarian function. Even spacesuits are bulkier and provide less\n    protection than those produced during the golden years of space exploration. <br />\n    In essence, humankind as a technological society is on the decline. <br /><br />\n    Humanity never would have left the cradle of our solar system without the foresight of visionary entrepreneur and businessman Peter Weyland. Under his stewardship, the Weyland Corporation\n    introduced three things that ensured humanity’s dominance over the stars—the capacity to travel at faster than light speeds, the introduction of the hypersleep chamber, and the ability to\n    terraform whole worlds.\n  </p>\n\n  <br /><br />\n  <table class=\"ntable\">\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"trhead\">\n          <h2 class=\"heading\">FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT</h2>\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"trhead\">\n          <h2 class=\"heading\">HYPER SLEEPING WITH THE STARS</h2>\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr class=\"tr2\">\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol2\">\n          The ability to travel faster than light is the lynchpin of humanity’s expansion outside our own solar system. Without it, there would be no extrasolar colonies and no corporate star empires.\n          First developed by Weyland Industries in the 2030s, these engines are sometimes referred to as displacement drives. The system works on the principle of an inverse relationship between\n          velocity and the flow of time. <br />\n          An FTL drive achieves these speeds by displacing the volume of space preceding a spacecraft and drawing the vessel forward with it. Accelerating to faster than light speeds is not\n          instantaneous. Ion thrusters build speed up to the point where the displacement drive can take over, gradually propelling starships to several times the speed of light.\n          <br /><br />\n          When they were first deployed a hundred and fifty years ago, FTL engines could impel a starship such as a Heliades class Space Exploration Vehicle at 10 to 15 times the speed of light. Even\n          though modern ships can travel from 50 to upwards of 700 times FTL (read more in <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.1DIVqtcGuYzobFP3\" data-id=\"1DIVqtcGuYzobFP3\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">SPACECRAFT BASICS</a>), that still means it can take weeks or even years to travel the whole of charted\n          space. <br /><br />\n          To complicate matters, prolonged travel at faster than light speeds can cause a syndrome in mammals known as Neurological Distortion Disorder—or the NDDs for short (see the text above). To\n          combat this and to conserve resources on long trips, space travelers spend most of their FTL time in stasis.\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol2\">\n          Even before FTL was possible, hypersleep technology was in development. As early as the 2020s, Peter Weyland had ordered his scientists to find a way to extend life indefinitely. While not\n          exactly what Weyland had in mind, the resulting technology was a significant leap forward. The ability to slow a life-form’s biological processes to a near standstill was beneficial to both\n          the medical industry and deep space missions at sublight speeds. When FTL became a reality, stasis was adapted as a solution to resource management on space flights. Hypersleep was soon\n          found to offer other benefits to man’s health in space. Traveling faster than the speed of light can have a distortion effect on human perception. Known as Neurological Distortion Disorder,\n          this syndrome causes paranoia, epilepsy, psychotic behavior and other adverse effects. Worse than that, the faster one travels, the worse the symptoms. Stasis protects space travelers from\n          the NDDs, with the added benefit of arresting aging on a cellular level.\n          <br /><br />\n          <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">THE SLEEP OF AGES:</strong> The process of entering hypersleep involves a mixture of gases and lowering one's temperature significantly. While travelers\n          are not conscious when in stasis, they can—and are encouraged to—dream. As brain functions are also slowed during hypersleep, a single dream can last months. In fact, an entire industry has\n          been created to take advantage of this (see <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.AK14omgiSbH3QUbJ\" data-id=\"AK14omgiSbH3QUbJ\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">LIVING IN SPACE</a>). Dreaming in hypersleep promotes mental health and can help a body’s natural regenerative healing. <br /><br />\n          <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">RULES:</strong> After a number of days of FTL travel equal to the FTL rating of the ship (a lower rating means a faster ship), roll a D6 on the table\n          below. When the same number of days have passed again, roll again adding +1 to the roll. Keep rolling with the same frequency, each time adding an additional +1 to the roll. As stated above,\n          stasis offers protection from the NDDs, but being abruptly awakened from hypersleep is dangerous. Disorientation, headaches, chest pain, and nausea are all common side effects. While\n          uncommon, some severe cases have resulted in death. In game terms, a rude awakening from hypersleep counts as an attack against you rolled with six Base Dice. Should you be Broken by this\n          damage, you must make a Death Roll every Turn. In addition, hypersleep for any length of time will make you Dehydrated (see <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.DKEXiVGcVDmsykhM\" data-id=\"DKEXiVGcVDmsykhM\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">OTHER HAZARDS</a>.\n          The Hydr8tion drug (see <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.rlQAR4A0xNpnpUli\" data-id=\"rlQAR4A0xNpnpUli\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">OTHER EQUIPMENT</a>), taken before stasis, will counteract this effect.\n        </td>\n\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n  <br />\n  <table class=\"stable\">\n    <caption>\n      <h2 class=\"heading\">NEUROLOGICAL DISTORTION DISORDER</h2>\n    </caption>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr class=\"strhead\">\n        <td class=\"die\">Roll</td>\n        <td class=\"scol2\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"scol6\">EFFECT</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td class=\"die\">-5</td>\n        <td class=\"scol2\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"scol6\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">NO EFFECT.</strong> Yet.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td class=\"die\">6-7</td>\n        <td class=\"scol2\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"scol6\">\n          <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">PARANOIA.</strong> You become convinced that someone or something on board the ship is out to get you.

A recent development operates by generating waves of force throughout the length of the vessel which propel it past\n          light speed without the aid of thrusters. Called Gravity Drives, these systems create a distortion in space-time, allowing starships to enter Einsteinian Space—a relative state of\n          non-existence in the material universe, allowing ships to travel much faster than conventional FTL. <br />\n          The technology is a giant leap forward, but the NDDs still require travelers to enter stasis for prolonged journeys. The details of this process and the principles behind it are currently\n          classified by Weyland-Yutani. <br />\n          Still in experimental trials, Gravity Drives are mostly unknown on the Frontier, found only on high-end company yachts and exploration ships hailing from the Core Systems. <br /><br />\n          A fortuitous byproduct of the gravity drive is that the fields generated by it provide powerful protection against ballistic and energy attacks.

The game is a conversation between the players and the GM, back and forth, until a critical situation arises where the outcome is uncertain. <br />\n    Then it's time to break out the dice - <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.GmjXaBlXMQHjQBlg\" data-id=\"GmjXaBlXMQHjQBlg\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">ROLLING DICE</a>. <br />\n    It is the GM's job to put obstacles in your path and challenge your PCs, forcing them to show what they are really made of. <br />\n    But it is not up to the GM to decide what happens in the game - and above all, not how your story is supposed to end. That is decided in the game. <br />\n  </p>\n  <h3 class=\"heading2\"><i>That is why you are playing the game, to find out how your story ends.</i></h3>\n\n</div>",

The weapons described below are listed in the table to the below, which also includes prices.\n          More ship armaments will be described in future modules.\n          <br /><br />\n          <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">ASAT MISSILES:</strong> The typical main armament of military frigates, guided ASAT missiles have long range and pack a heavy punch.\n          Their main drawback is that they take some time to reach their target, giving it a chance to shoot the missile down or deploy countermeasures.\n          A missile battery can typically fit eight missiles. Individual missiles must be purchased separately.\n          <br /><br />\n          <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">RAILGUN:</strong> This close defense weapon uses superheated plasma to fire heavy metal rounds at extremely high speed, slicing through a ship’s armor like butter.\n          Railguns are not very accurate but extremely deadly at short range. All armor counts as half (round up) against railguns.\n          <br /><br />\n          <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">PARTICLE BEAM WEAPON:</strong> These weapons accelerate particles in a kinetic energy wave that causes damaging ionization, and can overheat electronics to the point of shutdown.\n          Particle beam weapons function differently from other ship armaments. <br />\n          First, countermeasures have no effect against them. <br />\n          Second, their base Damage rating is reduced one step for each range category beyond <b>CONTACT</b>. <br />\n          Third, they inflict no hull damage, only component damage.\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol2\">\n          <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">ORBITAL MINES:</strong> Cheap and very effective against unwanted boarding parties, orbital mines are a cost-effective short-range weapon.\n          Individual mines must be purchased separately.\n          <br /><br />\n          <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">TACTICAL NUKES:</strong> Shipborne nukes are deployed from orbit to destroy planetary based targets, even entire colonies.\n          A 50-megaton nuke will completely destroy all buildings and kill all living beings within a 10 km radius, and cause damage to buildings and people up to 100 km away from the center of detonation.\n          In addition, a high-altitude detonation will create an electromagnetic pulse that destroys unshielded electronics.\n          A nuclear missile battery can typically fit five missiles.

An M314 Motion Tracker, an Mk.50 Compression Suit, or an M41A Pulse Rifle can truly mean the difference between life and death for your character.\n    You can find these items and plenty of other gear described in the Gear Chapter.\n    You must write down all the items you are carrying on your character sheet.\n    Write down one item per row in the Gear section on the sheet.\n    If it’s not listed on your sheet, you don’t have it with you.\n    In Cinematic play, the scenario determines what gear you start the game with.\n    <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">STARTING GEAR:</strong>\n    In a Cinematic scenario, the scenario determines what gear you start the game with.\n    In Campaign play, your career determines what gear you can choose from at the start of the game. <br />\n    If you get a weapon, you always get two full reloads to go with it. <br />\n    In addition to the items you choose, you are assumed to have a uniform or civilian clothing. <br />\n    You also get some cash—the career indicates how much. <br />\n    Read more about cash and how to spend it in <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.1LcEh7ofb3DMCI7q\" data-id=\"1LcEh7ofb3DMCI7q\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">A HARD LIFE AMONGST THE STARS</a>\n    <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SIGNATURE ITEM:</strong>\n    In addition to your normal gear, you also have a signature item — a small item that’s not of much practical use, but that has sentimental value to you and that says something about your character.\n    <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">VEHICLES &amp; SPACESHIPS:</strong>\n    In some Cinematic scenarios, your PCs have a vehicle or even a spacecraft.\n    Usually, vehicles and starships don’t belong to one individual character — instead, they are crewed by the entire group of PCs together. <br />\n    In Campaign play, it’s also possible for your group to begin the campaign in possession of a vehicle or a ship.\n    Read more about this in<a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.1LcEh7ofb3DMCI7q\" data-id=\"1LcEh7ofb3DMCI7q\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">A HARD LIFE AMONGST THE STARS</a>\n  </p>\n  <br /><br />\n\n  <table class=\"ntable\" style=\"width:50%\">\n    <caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n      <b>EXAMPLE</b>\n    </caption>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n          Nat starts the game with a cutting torch, a compression suit, and $300 in cash. <br />\n          Her signature item is a tattoo of her dead partner’s name on the inside of her lower right arm.\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n  <br /><br />\n  <h2 class=\"heading\">ENCUMBRANCE</h2>\n  <p>\n    You can carry a number of regular-sized items equal to double your <b>STRENGTH</b> rating without problems.\n    A regular item is generally the size of a small bag and weighs no more than a few kilos.\n    <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">HEAVY &amp; LIGHT ITEMS:</strong> An item designated as <i>heavy</i> counts as two regular items, and typically takes up two rows on your character sheet.\n    Some heavy items count as three or even four normal items—the gear lists in Gear sections indicate this. <br />\n    At the opposite end of the spectrum, there are items that are designated as <i>light</i> — they count as half of a regular item, and so you can list two light items on one row on your sheet.\n    Some light items count as a quarter of a normal item in terms of encumbrance — the weight of such items is written as ¼ in the gear lists.\n    <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">TINY ITEMS:</strong> Items that are even smaller than light items are called <i>tiny</i>.\n    They are so small they don’t affect your encumbrance at all.\n    The rule of thumb is: if the item can be hidden in a closed fist, it’s tiny.\n    Tiny items also need to be listed on your character sheet.\n    <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">OVER-ENCUMBERED:</strong> You can temporarily carry up to twice your normal encumbrance limit, i.e. <b>STRENGTH</b> x 4 items.\n    If over-encumbered, you must make a <b>MOBILITY</b> roll when you want to run or crawl in a Round of combat (see <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.1xvGKPTWQTW1dTLA\" data-id=\"1xvGKPTWQTW1dTLA\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">ACTIONS &amp; INITIATIVE</a>).\n    If you fail, you must either drop what you are carrying, or stay put.\n  </p>\n  <br /> <br />\n  <h2 class=\"heading\">CONSUMABLES:</h2>\n  <p>\n    In the world of ALIEN, you need to overcome a lot more than Xenomorph life forms to survive.\n    Lack of air, food, water, and electric power can be just as deadly. These four resources are called consumables.\n    You don’t need to track consumables at all times.\n    In the confines of a functional spaceship, orbital station or planetside colony, you likely have the consumables you need.\n    The GM lets you know when resources are scarce and it’s time to start tracking them.\n    <br /> <br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SUPPLY:</strong> You track each of the four consumables on your character sheet using a Supply rating.\n    A higher rating is better. At regular intervals (see the table below), you need to make a Supply roll.\n    This means rolling a number of Stress Dice equal to the current Supply rating, up to a <i>maximum</i> of six dice.\n    For every <span class=\"stresssymbol\">  </span>  rolled, the Supply rating is decreased by one.\n    When the Supply rating reaches zero, you’re out of the consumable, and you’re entering a world of hurt. <br />\n    The effects of lacking air, food and water are explained in <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.DKEXiVGcVDmsykhM\" data-id=\"DKEXiVGcVDmsykhM\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">OTHER HAZARDS</a>.\n    <br /> <br />\n    <b> Group Consumables:</b> Usually, consumables are tracked individually, but they can also be tracked for the group as a whole, depending on the situation. <br />\n    The GM has final say.\n    <br /> <br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">ENCUMBRANCE:</strong>\n    For encumbrance, your supplies of food and water count as one item each, as long as your current Supply rating is 4 or lower.\n    See the table below.\n    When your Supply rating hits zero for food or water, this consumable no longer encumbers you.\n    Air and power don’t usually count toward your encumbrance, as they are generally included in your pressure suit or other gear. <br />\n    External air tanks or batteries can count as encumbering items however.\n    Read more in <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.Dixfy1foPnw3YSBj\" data-id=\"Dixfy1foPnw3YSBj\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">WEAPONS AND ARMOR</a>.\n  </p>\n  <br /><br />\n  <table class=\"etable\">\n    <caption>\n      FOOD AND WATER\n    </caption>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr class=\"ehead\">\n        <td class=\"ecol1\">SUPPLY RATING</td>\n        <td class=\"ecol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"ecol2\">COUNTS AS</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr class=\"etr\">\n        <td class=\"ecol1\">1-4</td>\n        <td class=\"ecol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"ecol2\">One Item</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr class=\"etr\">\n        <td class=\"ecol1\">5-8</td>\n        <td class=\"ecol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"ecol2\">Two Items</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr class=\"etr\">\n        <td class=\"ecol1\">Every 4</td>\n        <td class=\"ecol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"ecol2\">One More Item</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n\n  <br />\n  <h3 class=\"heading3\">WHEN TO MAKE SUPPLY ROLLS</h3>\n  <table class=\"stable\">\n    <caption>\n      How often you should make Supply rolls depends on the consumable in question, and the overall situation.

Another aging design that still sees use on the Frontier, the Starcub shuttle is often used as an auxiliary craft on freighters and other large ships.\n                    While older models only

attached to the USCSS Nostromo in 2122 when Warrant Officer Ripley used it to escape the starfreighter’s destruction.\n                    The second shuttle—the Salmacis—was damaged in a docking accident prior to Nostromo leaving Thedus and not aboard at the time, something that would never happen today.\n                    The new ICC safety protocols prohibit a ship from leaving port

Conestoga-Class Frigate is the most common ship in use by the USCMC and Colonial Marshal Bureau.\n                    The frigate boasts a modular interior for different assignment configurations, as well as numerous hard points for the addition or subtraction of weapons arrays.\n                    The Conestoga can be used as a science vessel, a military cargo hauler, a hospital ship, or, most commonly, a troop transport.\n                    The ship’s MU/TH/UR 9000 computer is capable of performing mission assignments without the aid of crew, so long as it does not need to make

his ass.\n                        It cut his tug in two and plows right into the damn energy tanker.\n                        The juice in those batteries went up real fast.\n

us. <br />\n                        Always. <br />\n                        I thought he was crazy until I saw they weren’t firing on us — not even a warning shot.\n                        Tomland was ex-military and knew his shit. <br />\n                        He figured the EMP from the tanker explosion had fried the Cony’s particle beams and ASATs, but her rails should have worked just fine. <br />\n                        Turns out the big bitch can't fire her big guns straight on — they’re right in the line of sight of her hull.\n                        For all her bluster, she’s got a blind spot right in front and behind her.\n                        Tommy kept us dead ahead of them until we gained enough distance to kick in the displacement drive and go FTL. <br />\n                        The marshals stayed behind to clean up the mess. <br />\n                        In the end, the cargo was blown, my contact was dead, the marshals were pissed, and the Cony was fried.\n                        We managed to get out of there though. <br />\n                        I scuttled the ship, quit the business and became a cattle rancher on Terraform 3. <br />\n

       Each <span class=\"basesymbol\"> </span> rolled removes one point of damage.\n                    If the ship was Disabled, repairing at least one point of damage removes this condition.\n                    <br /><br />\n                    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">COMPONENT REPAIRS:</strong> The lists of minor and major component damage describe which skill rolls are needed to repair the component, and how many rolls must be made.\n                    If several skill rolls are listed, only one roll can be made per Shift.\n                    Only one person can roll to repair the same component, but others can help.\n                    Component repairs also require spare parts.\n                    Spare parts are abstracted into two versions: mechanical and electronic.\n                    One mechanical spare part is required for each <b>HEAVY MACHINERY</b> roll, and one electronic spare part for each <b>COMTECH</b> roll.\n                    The spare part is consumed if the roll is successful.\n                    See the boxed text to the right for more on spare parts.\n                    <br /><br />\n                    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">EMERGENCY REPAIRS:</strong> During combat, ship engineers can make emergency repairs on components, but not the hull.\n                    This works like normal component repair (above) but with some key differences:\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Each repair roll takes one Turn instead of one Shift.</li>\n                        <li>The repairs require no spare parts.</li>\n                        <li>The repair is just a temporary fix, and the component will fail again after one Shift.</li>\n                    </ul>\n                    <br /><br />\n                    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">EVA REPAIRS:</strong> Hull repair, as well as repair of external components, will require you to go spacewalking.\n

style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n                                    You’ll soon learn how important spare parts for your ship can be.\n                                    There are two main ways to get more of them: buy and scavenge.\n                                    Costs can vary greatly, but a mechanical spare part is typically about $100,000 at your average spaceport, and an electronic spare part can cost you twice that sum.\n                                    If you don’t feel like paying for spare parts, deep space salvaging might be the business for you.\n                                    With a Shift of work and a skill roll ( <b>HEAVY MACHINERY</b> for mechanical and COMTECH for electronic), you can scavenge a spare part from a derelict, assuming it’s not completely blown to bits.\n                                    In total, you can typically scavenge a number of spare parts from a ship equal to its full Hull score—half mechanical and half electronic.\n

In the game, this is represented by what we call stealth mode. Stealth mode is played out in\n    Turns. <br />\n    In one Turn, you can move two zones on the map and explore them, scanning for enemies and getting a superficial description of these two zones from the GM. If you’re a team, you can explore the\n    map individually or as a group. <br />\n    If you want to examine something in a zone more closely, such as accessing a data terminal, you need to stay one entire Turn (or even longer) in a single zone. <br />\n    The GM has final say.\n  </p>\n  <br /><br />\n\n  <table class=\"ntable\">\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"trhead\">\n          <h2 class=\"heading\">ENEMY MOVEMENT</h2>\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"trhead\">\n          <h2 class=\"heading\">DETECTION</h2>\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr class=\"tr2\">\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol2\">\n          In stealth mode, enemy movement is handled secretly by the GM. This is carried out each Turn, after your PCs have moved. NPCs must comply with the same rules of movement as PCs—human NPCs\n          can only move two zones per Turn. Non-human characters may move faster or have other special rules. <br />\n          To handle NPC movement, we recommend that the GM has a second copy of the conflict map, hidden from view by the GM Screen (available for purchase separately). On this map, the GM can place\n          tokens to represent NPCs, hidden from the players’ view. <br />\n          If your GM doesn’t have access to a screen, she can simply track hidden NPC movement on a piece of paper.\n          <br /><br />\n\n          <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">ACTIVE AND PASSIVE ENEMIES:</strong> Enemies can be <b>ACTIVE</b> or <b>PASSIVE</b>, as dictated by the scenario or the GM. <b>ACTIVE</b> enemies are\n          aware of you and are actively stalking you. <br />\n          <b>PASSIVE</b> enemies are not aware of your presence and can be ambushed by you.\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol2\">\n          In stealth mode, you will automatically detect <b>PASSIVE</b> enemies in the same zone or in line of sight (above).

If you want to sneak past the <b>PASSIVE</b> enemies undetected or make a sneak attack, roll for <b> MOBILITY</b> against\n          their <b> OBSERVATION</b>. You get a modification based on the distance to the enemy — see the table on the next below. <br />\n          <br />\n          <b>ACTIVE</b> enemies nearby may try to sneak up on you for a sneak attack. If so, the GM informs you that a threat is moving in on you, and then rolls <b> MOBILITY</b> for the enemy\n          against your <b> OBSERVATION</b>. If you fail, the enemy gets a free attack against you. Read more about sneak attacks on page 56. You cannot spot <b>ACTIVE</b> enemies that choose to\n          remain hidden and don’t attack you—unless you have detected them using a motion tracker first, or the GM deems it obvious that you spot the enemy (for example, if you search the exact spot\n          where it is hidden).\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"trhead\">\n          <h2 class=\"heading\">MOTION TRACKERS</h2>\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"trhead\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr class=\"tr2\">\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol2\">\n          A useful piece of gear in stealth mode is a motion tracker, such as the M314 unit <br /> (see <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.rlQAR4A0xNpnpUli\" data-id=\"rlQAR4A0xNpnpUli\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">OTHER EQUIPMENT</a>).

Located between the core systems and the\n    Outer Rim, the Outer Veil is a vast region of space that is abundantly rich in mineral resources. The Outer Rim is extensively colonized, and the Colonial Navy operates there. <br />\n    Past the Outer Rim is anyone's guess - and that thrill of the unknown is what draws pioneers here. <br />\n    Settlers have likened the sometimes lawless Frontier to the Old West of the United States. Here, life is harsh and cheap. On many worlds, atmospheric processors have been brought in to convert\n    the air into something passably breathable. <br />\n    The majority of settlers here are prospectors, entrepreneurs, farmers, and homesteaders. <br />\n    Mining worlds refine ores and fuel, while agri and aquatic worlds harvest food and algae. Space stations such as Anchorpoint serve as a neutral staging ground for expeditions into deep space.\n    Neighboring colonies don't always get along, and armed conflicts over stakes and claims are not uncommon - often requiring the Colonial Marines to step in and restore order. <br />\n    The boundaries of the Frontier are ever-shifting, and sometimes colonies switch hands as border disputes redefine the map.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"heading2\">TERRITORIES OF THE FRONTIER</h2>\n  <p>\n    While dominated by the United Americas, the Frontier is an area intersected by several nation-states. An uneasy alliance exists between them, yet territorial disputes are not unheard of. What\n    follows is a listing of the major government players vying for resources there. <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\"> THREE WORLD EMPIRE:</strong> <br />\n    Consisting of the former United Kingdom, Japan, and several developing countries, the Weyland-Yutani corporation itself is a result of the formation of the Three World Empire - created when the\n    UK company Weyland Corp merged with the Japanese Yutani Corporation. The Three World Empire pioneered space exploration, controls many long-established inner colonies, and only maintains a\n    limited presence on the Frontier - allowing Weyland-Yutani to take the lead there. <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\"> THE UNITED AMERICAS:</strong><br />\n    Created in the early 2100s to compete with the expanding Three World Empire, the United Americas was formed by the merger of North, Central, and South America into one nation. The United\n    Americas is a major colonizing and starfaring power, constantly expanding the Frontier. They operate both the Colonial Marines and the Colonial Navy - the most powerful peace-keeping forces on\n    the Frontier. <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\"> THE UNION OF PROGRESSIVE PEOPLES:</strong><br />\n    The UPP is a powerful socialist block of systems that control a vast but resource poor sector of space. Formed from a coalition of countries that includes Russia and Vietnam, the UPP is the only\n    government that is not influenced by corporate concerns - a fact that sometimes puts them in opposition to Weyland-Yutani. While they are behind in the arms race, the UPP still maintains a\n    formidable fighting force. A state of cold war has existed between the United Americas and the UPP for decades, but with recent events on the Frontier, all that seems poised to change.\n    <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\"> THE INDEPENDENT CORE SYSTEM COLONIES:</strong><br />\n    The ICSC is a loose conglomerate of privately-owned worlds. Each colony in the ICSC has its own government - many of which are corporate-owned. In addition to its operations within the colonies\n    of the United Americas and the Three World Empire, Weyland-Yutani is known to maintain private interests in the ICSC - where they can conduct business as they see fit, far from the prying eyes\n    of government control. <br />\n  </p>\n\n  <br />\n\n  <p class=\"mess\">\n    <i>\n      SHIPS LOG, USCSS MIRANDA, 010:00.

Companies like Weyland-Yutani, BioNational, and Seegson are not limited by borders. In fact, they produce and control the technologies necessary for the continued existence of these star empires. The unwillingness of nation-states like the UPP to work with the private sector has left them behind in the space race.</p>\n\n  <p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\"> God at the Ass End of Space: </strong> <br />Life in the colonies is rough. After being promised a utopia, settlers instead found a frontier existence of drudgery in harsh environments. To that end, many have turned to God to get them through their daily rigors. While traditional religions are practiced throughout the colonies, sects of apocalyptic millenarian fundamentalists have arisen, as have fanatical cults and zealots driven by charismatic leaders in isolated areas. Recent years have seen the rise of fledgling organizations with questionable motives, such as the Practitioners of the Holy Immolation and the cultish Church of Immaculate Incubation.</p>\n\n  <br />\n  <table class=\"arpgtablesmall\" style=\"width:40%\">\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td><i style=\"color:azure\">“But how do you know?

Others talk of\n    derelict spacecraft - and a race of giants that once stalked the stars in them. Still others whisper about hostile lifeforms that overrun entire worlds - terrifying parasitic creatures that are\n    beyond our comprehension and wholly alien. <br />\n    Many believe Weyland-Yutani and other corporations are covertly developing new and dangerous biological weapons, ranging from plagues and drug-controlled psychopathic cyborgs to\n    genetically-engineered monsters. If these weapons really are being developed, one has to wonder who the company is designing them for, and if a war is on the horizon. Over the past century, ships,\n    stations, and even colonies have simply disappeared from the Frontier. Some attribute these losses to natural disasters or acts of God, others believe those involved fell prey to pirates or rival\n    governments. Rumors of entire colonies being wiped out by a plague or nuked off the face of a planet have everyone on the Frontier living on the edge. Some even believe that man was never meant to\n    leave Earth, and that space itself can swallow you whole. <br />\n    <br />\n    Shutter your storm blinds and seal the airlocks - something alien just might be out there, hiding in the dark. <br />\n  </p>\n  <h3 class=\"heading2\"><i>It's waiting for you.</i></h3>\n\n  <br />\n  <p class=\"mess\">\n    <i>\n      SHIPS LOG, USCSS MIRANDA, 015:09.

The loss of the Sulaco's Colonial Marine unit along with these Weyland-Yutani sponsored outposts, and the implications of corporate foul play stemming from these incidents, have\n    created an air of distrust between the company and the United Americas.

The book gives credence both to talk of monsters and to rumors of Weyland-Yutani\n    experimentation with bioweapons - indicating they were more concerned about securing the creature for further study than saving lives. According to Morse, the hunt to capture the beast had spilled\n    over from the incident on LV-426, and anyone who got in the Company's way was expendable - be they prisoners, soldiers, employees, or even colonists. Although banned instantly, copies of Space\n    Beast have been transmitted illegally throughout the colonies. The book has developed a strong following. Some see it as a fantasy, a welcome diversion from their normal lives. Others have\n    embraced Morse's story and built a millenarian cult around it - believing it to be a religious text and a portent of the Armageddon to come. <br /><br />\n    <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\"> THIS TIME IT'S WAR:</strong><br />\n    To add fuel to the fire, conflicts between the rival sectors of space have increased exponentially in the past five years. While unconfirmed, many believe that Hadley's Hope was a test site for\n    one of Weyland-Yutani's bioweapons and that an enemy state sent a warship to nuke it from orbit. Others believe that the Company is working with a rogue nation to assume control of the colonies on\n    the Frontier. As more and more Colonial Marine units are recalled and re-deployed to new campaigns, Frontier colonists are becoming scared. Without the military, there is no-one to protect them\n    from pirates, hostile lifeforms, or invasion. To compensate, many colonies have enacted their own law systems, electing Marshals to oversee daily law enforcement. Some have even hired mercenary\n    forces to protect their interests.\n  </p>\n  <h3 class=\"heading2\"><i>The 2180's are a dangerous time to be alive.</i></h3>\n\n  <br />\n  <p class=\"mess\">\n    <i>\n      SHIPS LOG, USCSS MIRANDA, 019:47.

These modular tractors can be fitted with bulldozer blades, diggers, cutters,\n          cranes, core samplers, spring stampers, welders, bore drills, combines, and more. Some colonists have even mounted weapons on these tractors and used them to protect their hard work.\n          Trailers can be hitched to the Daihotai and it can be used as a cross country cargo hauler (the farmers and ranchers on Terraform 3 use the tractors to ferry crops and steer to and from\n          the spaceport).

Its interior is equipped with a tactical command center with links to each\n          soldier’s helmet cams and biosigns. The exterior is armored with a laser absorbent paint job. <br />\n          In addition to chaff launchers and a small front mounted turret, the M570 mounts a rotating main weapons package on a rail system that allows it to slide back and store in the rear of the\n          vehicle when not in use, thus lowering the APC’s profile and heat signature. The air pressure in its large, armored wheels is controlled by the driver in order to facilitate better\n          traction over soft terrain and allow the vehicle's chassis some additional clearance over rough ground—its low profile is perhaps the APC’s biggest weakness. Put a reckless driver behind\n          the wheel in a rocky environment and you are likely to blow the transaxle. The amphibious and vacuum tight APC is designed to be carried in the vehicle bay of a Cheyenne dropship, allowing\n          it to be deployed nearly anywhere.

There are various two- and four-door types and\n          models ranging from luxury sports vehicles to the utilitarian. These microfusion reactor driven gyroscopic cars can operate as wheeled ground transports or utilize internal fans to\n          generate air cushions with a maximum flight ceiling of 3,000 meters. Cameras offer a 360-degree view and a proximity alert protects against collisions. <br />\n          Gyrocars require a lot of upkeep and are therefore a rare sight on the Frontier and Outer Rim.

While true gunships like the\n          Tomahawk are more heavily armed and strikeships like the Cougar and Bearcat are more maneuverable, none have the versatility of the Cheyenne. The Cheyenne are dropped from orbit into the\n          fray from the ventral bay of any USCM frigate or carrier, swiftly descending through the atmosphere like a meteor. The current model has been specifically augmented to carry the M577 into\n          a combat zone, deploy the APC and its marine squad, and immediately assume an air support role for the squad. The ship is mostly transport bay with cockpit, weapons systems, and engines\n          attached—there is little in the way of other accommodations aboard. While in supersonic decent, the Cheyenne’s weapons pods are retracted flush with its hull. These pods deploy for\n          subsonic combat. With a proper satellite uplink, the Cheyenne is capable of being flown by remote from a portable terminal. Few pilots have the skill necessary for this maneuver, and the\n          task is usually left to the squad’s android XO.\n          <br />\n          <span class=\"arpglink\">@UUID[Actor.TOwZ1mGVblFV1cpI]{UD-4L Cheyenne VTOL Dropship}</span>\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol2\">\n          <table class=\"stable\">\n            <tbody>\n              <tr>\n                <td class=\"scol3\">\n                  <b style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Encountered: </b>USCMC battlefields and military bases across the Frontier and Outer Rim.

The old but reliable Lifter is a flatbed sled with a crew cab, crane assembly, two high output engines and four oversized and\n          overpowered articulated maneuvering thruster pods. While not intended for deep space use, the Lifter’s pressurized cab is rated for use in a vacuum and she is capable of making low orbit\n          cargo transfers. Plates on the flatbed can be magnetized, and there are cargo clamp-down hardpoints at regular intervals across her hull. The Lifter’s crew can use a safety harness and\n          winch to exit the pressurized cab and perform emergency cargo balance adjustments while in flight. The remote operated extendable crane assembly is folded flush to the hull for flight and\n          can be equipped with a magnetic coupler, an excavator claw, hook and cable, or more. <br />\n          Just be warned: Deploying the crane in flight can cause the Lifter to destabilize and crash.

From the Free League website you can download character sheets for free to print.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"heading\">DICE</h2>\n  <p>\n    In the ALIEN universe, nowhere is safe. Sooner or later, you will end up in situations where the outcome is uncertain, no matter how skilled you are.\n    It's time to break out the dice. <br />\n    There are two types of custom six-sided dice for this game, each available for purchase separately: Base Dice and Stress Dice.\n    You roll the dice when you perform a dramatic action that might determine if your PC lives or dies. <br />\n    Both Base Dice and Stress Dice have the <span class=\"basesymbol\">  </span>  symbol on the 6 side.<br /><br />\n    Rolling the <span class=\"basesymbol\">  </span>  symbol usually means that an effect of some kind is triggered, for example when succeeding at using a skill. <br /><br />\n    Stress Dice also have the symbol <span class=\"stresssymbol\">  </span>  on the 1 side. <br /><br />\n    Rolling the <span class=\"stresssymbol\">  </span>  symbol triggers panic in your character. How all this works in detail, you will learn in the Skills Chapter.\n    <br />\n    <br /> NOTE:<br /> <i>You can play this game with any normal six-sided dice, but it helps if you have them in two different colors to tell Base Dice and Stress Dice apart.</i>\n\n  </p>\n  <br />\n  <h2 class=\"heading\">CARDS</h2>\n  <p>\n    The boxed set contains two types of custom playing cards.\n    The ten numbered initiative cards are used for drawing initiative in combat (see <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.1xvGKPTWQTW1dTLA\" data-id=\"1xvGKPTWQTW1dTLA\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">ACTIONS &amp; INITIATIVE</a>), while the Personal Agenda cards are used in the Chariot of the Gods scenario — if you are player in the game, do not look at these cards until instructed to do so by the GM.\n  </p>\n  <br />\n  <br />\n  <p class=\"mess\">\n    <i>\n      SHIPS LOG, USCSS MIRANDA, 065:45.

The alien represents everything we don't\n    understand about the natural world.\n    <br />\n    <br />It evokes a fear of our bodies being violated and used. It is a parasitic invader whose only intent is to use humanity to breed and incubate its progeny.

The average blue-collar worker here is a farmer, a pioneer, a maintenance engineer, a wildcatter, a prospector, a miner, a space\n    trucker, a marshal, a manager or a soldier—all dirty and hard-working professions. Only a select few get to call themselves explorers.\n    <br />\n    The best long-term option available to the common human is to become a Frontier colonist. The vetting process isn’t easy—in addition to competency and physical prerequisites, candidates must\n    endure an intense psychological screening process that many potential colonists fail. <br />\n    However, once you are approved for a colony, you are essentially set up in that position for life, assuming\n    you don't screw up royally. <br /><br />\n    Corporations and the colonial administration can’t be bothered to replace a farmsteader or terraforming maintenance engineer like you for minor infractions. Also, the\n    job has the added bonus of your descendants inheriting your position.\n    <br /><br />\n    Unfortunately, there is no glory or glamour to be had as a colonist—the colonies on the Frontier are experiencing an economic depression while the companies in the Core Systems grow fat off of the\n    hard labor of others. Supplies are limited and more often than not, colonists are told to ration and improvise.\n  </p>\n  <br /><br />\n  <h2 class=\"heading\">JUST IN TOWN FOR SUPPLIES</h2>\n  <p>\n    While most Frontier jobs are colony-based, they all interact in one way or another. <br />\n    Prospectors and wildcatters survey the terrain, staking claims to mineral deposits and drilling exploratory wells in unexplored regions. <br />\n    Miners often serve a one-year contract at a particular colony site before being rotated out. <br />\n    Farmers grow produce, maintenance engineers keep the atmospheric processors running, general managers oversee it all, and the marshals keep everyone in line. <br />\n    Space truckers deliver supplies to the colony and bring that world’s exports back to the Inner Core Systems.\n    Many corporate cargo haulers are former Colonial Navy veterans who are down on their\n    luck. <br />\n    The Colonial Marines and Navy protect these worlds, also rotating in and out along the Frontier. <br />\n    Finally, corporations will send security and assessment teams to ensure their resources are\n    being well cared for.\n    <br />\n    Taken all together, it represents the well-oiled machine of commerce — and everyone in it is just a cog, a replaceable cog.\n    <br /><br />\n    Then there is the fringe element. <br />\n    Mercenaries, vagabonds and privateers move from colony to colony, looking to eke out a living on the fringe of normal society. Some are criminals on the run, others are just disenchanted with\n    colonial and corporate bureaucracy. <br />\n    Many are dangerous.\n  </p>\n  <br /><br />\n  <table class=\"ntable\">\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"trhead\">\n          <h2 class=\"heading\">SPACESHIPS</h2>\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"trhead\">\n          <h2 class=\"heading\">SPACE STATIONS</h2>\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr class=\"tr2\">\n        <td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol2\">\n          Between scouting missions and cargo runs, people on the Frontier spend a lot of time in massive metal cans hurtling through space.

Mars soon followed.\n          While global warming was arrested as soon as the processors took effect, it still took decades to make the Earth whole again.\n          In a move to acclimate people to the idea of life amongst the stars, Sir Peter Weyland offered incentives to move off-world and colonize the solar system while the Earth healed. <br />\n          The strategy was successful, and soon colonies were popping up as far away as Saturn.\n          Within a decade of the inception of the FTL drive, Weyland Industries had set up an Atmospheric Processing Plant (APP) on an extrasolar world, and it wasn't long before people were eager to colonize there as well.\n          In the 21st Century, terraforming helped humanity to settle the stars.\n          The costly process was exacting and only performed on planets that had near earth conditions, thus prompting the planet to help sustain itself once the expensive terraforming was complete. <br /><br />\n          When the Yutani Corporation merged with Weyland Corp at the start of the 22nd Century, terraforming was deemed unprofitable and put to rest.\n          Instead, W-Y astronomers searched the heavens for planets that could support human life on their own.\n          Colony missions like the Affiance and the ill-fated Covenant were sent off to start life on newly discovered Earth-like planets.\n          Without the enormous economic strain that the Weyland Corporation had endured in their efforts to transform entire worlds, Weyland-Yutani prospered.\n          The new model wouldn’t last. As more and more people relocated to the existing off-world colonies, populations on these worlds soared and resources again diminished.\n          Soon, the supply of habitable worlds was outweighed by demand.\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol2\">\n          <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">BUILDING BETTER WORLDS:</strong> Over the next fifty years, more and more resources were found on barren worlds along the shifting Frontier, prompting Weyland-Yutani to resurrect terraforming and create a new fast and dirty form of atmospheric processing.\n          Recycling a hundred-year-old ad campaign, Weyland-Yutani again boasted they were “building better worlds.” <br />\n          The claim was and still is debatable. <br />\n          Colloquially called a “Shake and Bake” colony, an Atmospheric Processor (AP) is introduced to a planet or moon to scrub its atmosphere without the safety standards of the original Weyland APPs.\n          Essentially giant fusion reactors, these completely automated W-Y APs still require constant monitoring and maintenance, and colonies are often set up on worlds for the sole purpose of servicing them.\n          Weyland-Yutani has deployed APPs across the Frontier, creating colonies on any world that might have exploitable resources. <br /><br />\n          Terraforming can be a misnomer. <br />\n          It can take decades to transform a planet’s ecology, and it doesn't always hold. Most of the worlds undergoing the process will never become earth-like.\n          They are barren, desolate, and alien places that the processors can only alter enough for man to survive on without a pressure suit. <br />\n          Some of these worlds even require APs to constantly run in order to maintain a suitable atmosphere, making the processor a prime target for enemy powers and insurgents.\n          Some planets or planetoids that are rich in mineral resources are simply unable to even begin to support the terraforming process.\n          In those cases, pressurized facilities are built on the surface to house laborers and their families.\n          Because of this, colonies can be built in nearly any environment.

penance.\n          Unsurprisingly, the largest fanatical followings are on prison colonies, where the population has nothing to do but await apocalyptic redemption.\n          As such, doomsayer groups often attract reformed murderers and rapists.\n          Punishment for those who stray is often severe, ranging from isolation to starvation, severe beatings, and even mutilation.\n

squashed and the Order was transplanted to the artificial satellite world of Arceon (more on Arceon in the space station section).\n          There they live a monastic and mostly technologically free

suspect they might be a splinter faction of the infamous Earthsavers cult. <br />\n          A century-old group originally formed by dreamer and self-proclaimed prophet Duncan Fields, the Earthsavers believed that humanity's sojourn to the stars would herald the apocalypse.\n          Like that long dead organization, the Church of Immaculate Incubation places heavy emphasis on the apocalyptic dreams of its fanatical seers.\n          They believe the end times are fast approaching, but their spin is that the only survivors will be those who have sought out and achieved transformation to a higher form.\n          This metamorphosis is attained by accepting what they call the Seed of God into their hearts.\n          With few members and nothing to back up their claims, the Church of Immaculate Incubation is essentially harmless.\n          Believing the alien creature in Robert Morse’s banned book to have messianic significance to the imminent apocalypse, the Church readily distributes illegal copies of Space Beast throughout the colonies.\n          As they seek to share the dreams of their prophets with their flock, they also actively recruit professional dreamers to their cause.\n          Their enigmatic leader is rumored to be a wealthy man who has forsaken the good life and poured his resources into the Church.\n        </td>\n\n        <td

enforce colonial law over corporate policy, but many have been paid to look the other way when it comes to company business.\n          <br /><br />\n          <strong

Those that don’t are still under the jurisdiction and protection of the USCMC and the United Americas Outer Rim Defense Fleet, and are usually within days to weeks of receiving support in case of an emergency.\n          Operated by the United Americas Allied Command, they keep order on the borders of known space.\n          While other nations have their own soldiers and support ships, none save

Instead, consider it a dramatic peak in your story—a moment to remember, a fallen comrade to mourn—and then\n                  get back into the action as soon as possible. In Cinematic scenarios like the one included in this Starter Kit, the GM will generally have another character or NPC ready for you to\n                  play.\n                </td>\n              </tr>\n            </tbody>\n          </table>\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n        <td class=\"tcol2\">\n          If you suffer a critical injury listed as fatal, you must make a Death Roll when the listed time runs out. A Death Roll is a roll for <b>STAMINA</b>, but you cannot push the roll and you\n          are not allowed to roll any Stress Dice. If the Death Roll fails, you die. If you succeed, you linger on but you must make another Death Roll when the listed amount of time has passed\n          again. <br /><br />\n          <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SAVING YOUR LIFE:</strong> To save your life when you have suffered a fatal critical injury, someone must give you first aid before you fail a Death\n          Roll. First aid is a slow action and requires a <b>MEDICAL AID</b> roll. Note that some critical injuries are so severe that a negative modification is applied to the\n          <b>MEDICAL AID</b> roll. If you recover a Health point by yourself (after one Turn, see above) before you fail a Death Roll, you can try to give yourself first aid, but you get a –2\n          modification to the roll. Each character who attempts to treat you can try only once — to get a second chance, better medical equipment is needed. <br /><br />\n          <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">BROKEN:</strong> If you are both Broken and have sustained a fatal critical injury (or several), two separate <b>MEDICAL AID</b> rolls are needed: one to\n          get you back on your feet, and another to save your life. These two rolls can be made in whichever order you prefer. <br /><br />\n          <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">INSTANT KILL:</strong> Note that there are four critical injuries (results #63–66) that kill you outright.

There’s a flip side to this though—if you roll one or more <span class=\"stresssymbol\"> </span> on your Stress Dice, you must make a Panic Roll. <br /><br /><br />\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h2 class=\"heading\">STOPPING PANIC</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Some effects on the Panic Roll table are immediate or last one Round. Others remain in effect until one of the following happens: <br />\n<ul>\n<li>Another character comes to your aid and makes a <strong>COMMAND</strong> roll (see <a class=\"content-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-link data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.3fWnbTTXuO7jysUq\" data-id=\"3fWnbTTXuO7jysUq\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">THE SKILLS</a>).

But if the tension grows too strong it can explode, sending you into a wild panic. You need to make a Panic Roll when any of the following happens: <br />\n<ul>\n<li>You roll one or more <span class=\"stresssymbol\"> </span> on your Stress Dice in a skill roll. If this happens, you can't push the skill roll—instead, roll for panic.</li>\n<li>You witness a friendly character suffering from a certain panic effect (see the table below).</li>\n<li>You are pinned down by a ranged attack.</li>\n<li>You suffer a critical injury.</li>\n<li>You’re attacked by a strange alien creature that you’ve never seen before.</li>\n<li>A truly horrifying event occurs, as determined by a scenario or the GM.</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">RESOLUTION:</strong> Roll a D6, add your current <strong>STRESS LEVEL</strong>, and check the table to the right. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">PANIC ACTIONS:</strong> If you roll a 10 or higher on your Panic Roll, you will be forced to perform a specific action. If the Panic Roll was the result of a skill check for an action, the action is cancelled and immediately replaced by the forced panic action, even if you rolled <span class=\"stresssymbol\"> </span> . <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">MORE PANIC:</strong> If you are suffering from a panic effect (7+ on the Panic Roll) and are forced to make another Panic Roll, the new panic effect replaces the previous one. If the new roll is lower than the previous effect, however, it is automatically adjusted to one step more severe than the previous effect. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\"> OVERKILL:</strong> The Overkill talent lets you replace the effect of a Panic Roll result of 11 or higher by the Overkill effect, if you have any enemies in sight. When triggering Overkill, you must immediately attack your enemies and you won’t stop until you or all enemies in sight are Broken. Also, all other PCs in <strong>SHORT</strong> range of you must make an immediate Panic Roll.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h2 class=\"heading\">RELIEVING STRESS</h2>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h2 class=\"heading\">PERMANENT MENTAL TRAUMA</h2>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">For every full Turn (5–10 minutes) spent resting in a safe area that is secured from enemies (as far as you know), your <strong>STRESS LEVEL</strong> is reduced by one point. You cannot make any skill rolls when resting, and if your rest is interrupted, it doesn’t count. A Panic Roll can also decrease stress, as can certain drugs.

Roleplaying is a unique form of gaming, or cultural expression if you prefer to call it that, that combines tabletop gaming with storytelling. <br />\n    Roleplaying games give you a set of rules and let you create your own story with your friends in a way that books, movies, TV, and even video games cannot. <br />\n    The advantage of roleplaying games is also their challenge'the freedom to create the story yourselves can be overwhelming. <br />\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    But this rulebook contains plenty of exciting encounters, locations and characters that you can populate your story with, and very specific tools for the GM to use. <br />\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If you need advice or ideas, there is a forum for the ALIEN roleplaying game as well as our other games on our website:\n    <span class=\"fntXlarge\"> <a href=\"http://www.freeleaguepublishing.com\">www.freeleaguepublishing.com</a></span>\n    <br />\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"heading\">Welcome.</h2>\n  <br /> <br />\n  <p class=\"mess\">\n    <i>\n      SHIPS LOG, USCSS MIRANDA, 071:08.

Anyone hit by a U-238 bullet suffers 1 Rad in addition to normal damage. <br />Carrying a weapon loaded with U-238 tipped bullets gives you 1 Rad per Shift.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<table class=\"bigtable\"><caption>\n<h2 class=\"heading\">RIFLES</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"strhead\">\n<td class=\"crit\">WEAPON</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">BONUS</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">DAMAGE</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">RANGE</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">WEIGHT</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">COST</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">COMMENT</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"fatal\">Armat M41A Pulse Rifle</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">+1</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">2</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Long</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">1</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">$1,200</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Armor piercing, full auto, grenade launcher</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"fatal\">AK-4047 Pulse Assault Rifle</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">-</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">2</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Long</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">1</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">$500</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Full Auto</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"fatal\">M42A Scope Rifle</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">+2</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">2</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Extreme</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">1</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">$1,000</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Armor piercing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"fatal\">Armat Model 37A2 12 Gauge Pump Action</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">+2</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">3</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Short</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">1</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">$500</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Armor doubled</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"fatal\">SpaceSub ASSO-400 Harpoon Grappling Gun</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">-</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">1</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Medium</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">1</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">$300</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Armor doubled, single-shot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"fatal\">Armat XM99A Phased Plasma Pulse Rifle</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">-</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">4</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Extreme</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">1</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">$20,000</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Armor piercing, Power Supply 5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><br />\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">ARMAT M41A PULSE RIFLE:</strong> The standard issue weapon of the USCMC, the M41A Pulse Rifle is a 10mm automatic assault rifle with underslung 30mm pump-action grenade launcher combined in a sturdy housing with retractable stock and optional scope. The M41A fires explosive-tip caseless standard light armor-penetrating US M309 rounds accelerated via electronic pulse. Remaining ammo is tracked via an LED counter and the rifle has two firing modes—burst and full automatic. For more about the grenade launcher, see the U1 below. An otherwise reliable weapon, the M41A can jam when fully-loaded, so partially loaded magazines are recommended. (In their downtime on mission Marines will take the time to remove a few rounds from each of the magazines they carry.) Even with this flaw, the M41A is what you want slung over your shoulder—but if you are a civilian, good luck getting a permit to own one. <br /><span class=\"arpglink\">@UUID[Item.d6oy7C3bytDfErVT]{Armat M41A Pulse Rifle}</span></td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> <span class=\"M41A\"> </span> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">AK-4047 PULSE ASSAULT RIFLE:</strong> The UPP equivalent to the M41A Pulse Rifle, the AK-4047 is a cheap and reliable substitute.

Armor Rating 2, Maximum Air Supply 5. <br /><span class=\"arpglink\">@UUID[Item.eCNxHK5HzYrLLLi2]{IRC Mk.50 Compression Suit}</span> <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">IRC MK.35 PRESSURE SUIT:</strong> Standard issue for the USCMC, the Mk.35 is an unfortunately bulky combat pressure suit with a cumbersome recycler unit. You want to be careful wearing one of these in a fight, as the hard joints tend to seize up with extreme motion. While the inexpensive suit offers full protection from the vacuum of space, you have to spend time in a decompression chamber after spacewalking in one. Basically, this suit sucks, but if the choice is a Mk.35 or the cold of space, shut up and suit up. Armor Rating 5, Maximum Air Supply 4.

The helmet has a sophisticated heads-up display built in, and the suit has its own thrusters for tether-free zero-G maneuvers. The comm array on a standard Eco EVA Suit is unshielded, and thus sensitive to rogue transmissions. Armor Rating 4, Maximum Air Supply 6.

While an APEsuit cannot protect you from the vacuum of space, it does offer a filtered air supply, limited armor, resistance to temperature extremes, and is impervious to caustic substances. The helmet includes protective eyewear and a mask to protect the wearer’s face. The suit is commonly worn by Weyland-Yutani’s security commandos and “Dog Catcher” units to contain hostile organisms, so if you see a bunch of guys show up wearing these, get the hell out of there—because what they are looking for just might find you. Armor Rating 3, bonus +3 to SURVIVAL rolls.

The exosuit amplifies your strength tenfold and is equipped with hydraulic claws for lifting and grasping. A roll cage protects your face while you operate one, and a webbed harness keeps you strapped in in case you take a tumble. The P-5000 is difficult to master, but a pro can make operating it seem as simple as walking. Many variants exist, including a weaponized version and a wheeled work loader for larger loads. HEAVY MACHINERY and CLOSE COMBAT +3, base Damage rating 3 in close combat attacks.

If you do not have access to the custom card deck, a normal deck of cards works fine, with the ace counting as the one. <br />All the players taking part in the conflict — whether voluntarily or involuntarily — each draw a card and the GM draws one card for every NPC. This is called drawing the initiative. The number on the card determines the order in which you act in the conflict, lowest to highest. <br />Number 1 acts first, number 2 acts second, and so forth until everyone has acted. Place your initiative card by your character sheet, so everyone can see in which order you act. The GM puts her initiative cards in front of her. <br />When all the participants in the combat have acted once, the Round is over, and a new Round begins.

No roll is required to run, unless it’s into a Cluttered zone (see <a class=\"content-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-link data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.04v7rgarjy1UIZkQ.JournalEntryPage.hzMmb8jmKoGIapb0\" data-id=\"hzMmb8jmKoGIapb0\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">TIME &amp; SPACE</a>). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CRAWLING:</strong> If you are prone, you can’t run.

In a Cramped zone, crawling is the only movement possible. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CLOSE COMBAT:</strong> If you have an active enemy at <strong>Engaged</strong> range, you can’t just walk away from them.

You can achieve this in several different ways. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SNEAK ATTACK:</strong> When you stalk someone and your attack catches them unawares, it’s called a sneak attack. First, roll your <strong>MOBILITY</strong> versus your target’s <strong>OBSERVATION</strong>. You get a modification depending on how close you want to go. See the table to the right. <br />If you want to attack in close combat, you usually have to move to within <strong>Engaged</strong> range of your enemy. If you fail, your opponent spots you at your starting distance—draw initiative.<br />If you succeed, you get a free action (slow or fast, but not both) before you draw the initiative. Your target cannot block a sneak attack. Sneak attacks are always done individually, by one attacker against one target. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">AMBUSH:</strong> A special kind of sneak attack is an ambush. <br />You lie in wait for your enemy and attack when they come close. When you ambush someone, you roll <strong>MOBILITY</strong> as described above, but with a modification of +2, since it is the target and not the attacker that is moving. Ambushes can be carried out by a group and against a group of targets. <br />This follows the usual rules for stealth—the character with the lowest <strong>MOBILITY</strong> skill level rolls for the attackers, while the target with highest <strong>OBSERVATION</strong> skill level rolls for the targets.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption style=\"color:deepskyblue\"><strong> SNEAK ATTACKS &amp; AMBUSHES </strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"ehead\">\n<td class=\"scol1\">RANGE</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">MODIFICATION</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\">Engaged</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">–2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\">Short</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">–1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\">Medium</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\">Long</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\">Extreme</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">+3</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>",

It influences your attributes, your skills, your starting gear and what starting talent you can have. There are nine\n      core careers to choose from, described in the CHARACTER ARCHETYPES section. <br />\n      Career descriptions can feel stereotypical, and they are meant to. Picking a career is a quick way for you—and the other players in the group—to get an immediate feel for your character. <br />\n      But remember that your character is more than just a career. Your career is merely a starting point toward creating a unique player character.\n    </p>\n    <table class=\"ntable\" style=\"width:50%\">\n      <caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n        <b>EXAMPLE</b>\n      </caption>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">\n            We’re creating a new character for Campaign play. <br />\n            She’s a roughneck named Nat. \n          </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n    <br />\n    <h2 class=\"heading\">ATTRIBUTES</h2>\n    <p>\n      Your character has four attributes that indicate your basic physical and mental capabilities, each rated on a scale from 1 to 5.

The advent of newer and faster FTL drives has\n    significantly shortened the travel time between worlds, ensuring that starship crews don't have to spend nearly as much time in stasis. Most companies compensate their crews not only for their\n    work but for time lost in hypersleep as well. While most space truckers work for one corporation or another, there are also independent trader captains, smugglers, salvage crews, and privateers.\n    Space is big and, legally or off the books, people and things always need to get from one side of it to the other.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"heading2\">COLONIAL MARINES</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The United States Colonial Marine Corps represents the finest fighting force ever assembled. Technologically advanced and sporting all the latest in military hardware - a large amount of which\n    is designed by Weyland-Yutani - the Colonial Marines are able to operate independently in nearly any environment. Combat teams are cross-trained and can be deployed at a moment's notice to\n    nearly any world without extensive briefing. Military occupations include vehicle operators and pilots, combat technicians, heavy weapons specialists, medics, engineers, and career officers.\n    Naval occupations are found in the USCM support service of warship and starfighter teams of the United Americas Outer Rim Defense Fleet, and there are special military R&amp;D programs across the\n    spectrum that require volunteers. On the Frontier, there is always something that needs defending and some planet that needs pacifying.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"heading2\">COMPANY REPS</h2>\n  <p>\n    Corporations have more power than governments on the Frontier. They own worlds, set up shop, and bring in the colonists, creating homes and jobs. From CEOs to field agents, each company sends\n    out its own representatives to oversee their business ventures. Companies like Weyland-Yutani have been known to employ their own commando security teams, doctors, and scientists as well. Also,\n    there is big business in knowing your competitors' next move - so many corporations have their own counterintelligence personnel embedded in rival companies and governments. Being a company rep\n    is all about the art of the deal and making sure the little people around you do their jobs so that you can make your next promotion.\n  </p>\n</div>",

Years ago a rebel faction revolted and attempted to take over the planet’s government. Without the resources on the Outer Rim to handle the threat, the Three World Empire requested assistance from the United Americas Allied Command. Eager to help in exchange for new tariff and export treaties, the United Americas sent in the marines. Because the Colonial Marines considered the rebel raids little more than a nuisance, the rebelling colonists were nicknamed “Bug-Boys.” <br />The situation changed when the Bug-Boys started using sophisticated weapons from an unidentified source—either a corporate or political enemy of the Three World Empire—and managed to cripple the USCMC frigate USS Sulaco with an orbital strike. The USCMC retaliated in kind, bringing in ships, marines, heavy equipment and tanks to retake the planet. The Bug-Boys were squashed, and the USCMC has maintained an occupying peace force on Linna 349 ever since, despite requests from the Three World Empire to release the world. Linna’s major export is the exceptional timber produced from its native thorny Karyta trees.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"bigtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Location</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Outer Rim, Anglo-Japanese Arm, Tartarus Sector</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Affiliation</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Three World Empire, UA occupying peace force in presence.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Classification</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Terrestrial planet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Climate</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Breathable atmosphere, humid and wet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Mean Temperature</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">30°C</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Terrain</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Forests and lakes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Colonies</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Two official plus nomad tribes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Population</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">30,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Key Resources</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Timber, lanthanum, lutetium, and other rare earth metals</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

One hundred years ago, a survey detected life moving beneath Aires’ frozen surface, and a large scientific expedition was launched to investigate. Sadly, nothing more has been seen or recorded for a century. <br /><br />When the Weyland Corp expedition was recalled, only a rotating skeleton crew was assigned to monitor the planet.Now, a crew of thirty-two scientists, administrators, and security officers live on an aging buoyant/submersible research and monitoring platform built to accommodate two hundred. The team has two antique submarines, four research pods, and a dropship to get them to and from orbit. Assignment to Aires Platform is considered a dead end for W-Y scientists with experience and a good start for interns and new hires.

While new arrivals here scramble to alert the UPP SOF Command of any contact, old timers know the drill. Znoy Outpost is mostly underground, having been driven into the rock like a giant stake.

Supply ships can only approach when the outpost is on the night side, as the planetoid itself shields the transports from the extreme heat of the sun. <br />Assignment to Znoy is considered a punishment. It is understaffed and ill-equipped to face even an unlikely invasion that might come through this area. While it is equipped with system-wide orbital nuclear arrays, the outpost itself has only two dropships and four heat-shielded tracked vehicles for surface operations. To make matters worse for the soldiers assigned there, Znoy is the closest UPP military installation to Zeta Reticuli, and the United Americas Allied Command is investigating the possibility that a UPP strike was launched there against Hadley’s Hope. If such an attack did happen, the UAAC believes it would have originated from Znoy.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"bigtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Location</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Outer Veil, Bao Sau Sector</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Affiliation</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">UPP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Classification</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Terrestrial planet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Climate</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">No atmosphere</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Mean Temperature</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">–173°C at night to 427°C during the day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Terrain</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Barren cratered rock</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Colonies</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">None, military monitoring outpost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Population</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">115 soldiers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Key Resources</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Heavy metals in asteroid belt</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

The first, orbiting Gamma Leporis B, ended in catastrophic failure when an asteroid collided with the planet. The second is more confusing. Contact was lost with the Seegson sponsored terraforming colony orbiting Gamma Leporis C in 2175. When the company went to investigate, they found that all the colonists had simply disappeared without a trace. The colony itself was undisturbed, save for the fact that the atmospheric processor had been shut down. The planet is generally avoided and whatever happened remains a mystery to this day. <br />Finally, the Gamma Leporis system is one of many locations of mysterious \"ghost ship\" sightings of the lost USCMC Conestoga-class troop transport the Sulaco.

Vast sections of the planet’s surface have been strip-mined, leaving behind huge gouges and deep canyon trenches. Much of the material exported from the far Frontier is routed through either Thedus or Anchorpoint Station before heading to the Outer Veil and Core Systems. Due to a severe environmental accident in 2109, parts of the planet were rendered uninhabitable for many decades. A miners’ revolt over poor living conditions led to the troop carrier UAS Archangel being deployed to the planet in order to keep the peace. Through a series of classified events, the Archangel crashed, destroying one of the planet’s atmospheric processors and causing the deaths of over 15,000 civilians and marines. As of the 2180s, renewed terraforming has repaired much of the planetary damage, but Thedus’ atmosphere is still cold.

Sadly, the Zeta Reticuli system has been a reoccurring site of tragedy and misfortune.

As the prison allows visitors, processing centers had to be built to accommodate them. Eventually, several visiting families decided to settle there, transforming the processing center into its own corporate run colony. Settlements developed in radiating lines from the massive prison facility and collectively became known as “the Sprawl.” <br />Taking advantage of its natural resources, the Seegson Corporation built several factories in the Sprawl to mass-produce gyrocars. As Weyland Corp developed better technologies, the Seegson models became less popular. The factories closed, the colony became destitute and the future prospects for those living there grew increasingly bleak. Taking advantage of the situation, the Colonial Marine Corps opened their largest recruitment center in the Outer Rim on DP-27.

Temperatures vary widely as the world makes its orbit around the binary stars of Fiori 16a and b. Fury is home to a large variety of fish, as well as at least one group of primitive land animals. Unfortunately, the most prolific species on the planet is a small arthropod that is similar to lice, making it mandatory that all visitors shave their body hair. Fury 161’s year is only ten days long—and half of that year is in darkness. Determined to be rich in platinum, the planet was extensively mined for decades. Estimates proved to be optimistic, however, and Fury 161’s resources tapped out quickly. Never one to miss a beat, Weyland-Yutani converted the worksite to a Class C Work Correctional Unit and lead works for radioactive and toxic waste disposal, leasing it to the Three World Empire. While at its height the facility housed thousands of prisoners, it was closed in the 2170s—leaving only a custodial staff and less than two dozen inmates to keep the facility running.In 2179, an EEV pod from the errant starship Sulaco crash-landed on the planet, bringing some kind of contagion.

Weyland-Yutani dispatched the Medical frigate Patna to Fury 161 but were too late to save all but one inmate—Robert Morse. <br />The story has been sensationalized by Morse’s banned book Space Beast, in which he claims that it wasn’t a contagion but a hostile organism that was on board the EEV, and that it slew nearly everyone before it was finally put down. Morse also claims the company was at fault for the massacre. Weyland-Yutani has recently put the facility on the market to be sold as scrap, but so far there has been no takers.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"bigtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Location</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Outer Veil, Neroid Sector, Anglo-Japanese Arm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Affiliation</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Weyland-Yutani, Three World Empire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Classification</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Terrestrial planet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Climate</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Breathable atmosphere, constantly swept with howling winds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Mean Temperature</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">–20°C to a balmy 40°C</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Terrain</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Flat deserts and dark acidic oceans</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Colonies</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Former industrial colony turned prison, now closed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Population</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Key Resources</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Formerly labor force and heavy metals, now industrial scrap and quinitricetyline</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

The Wells lies directly over a massive natural spring that produces fresh water with naturally occurring electrolytes—making it a favorite of the elite and sought after in the Inner Core Systems. <br />Contracts with several corporate concerns see that the moon is heavily mined for its water, iron, and uranium reserves which are sold at a premium while the colonists are forced to live in squalor. As petitions for better living standards have been ignored by the greater United American government, a small South American state has seen the plight of the Wells colony as a means to gain more power in the UA. As such, they have begun encouraging the rebels to sabotage supply lines while making demands for better wages and supplies.

Gaska, published separately. <br /><br />\n        More Cinematic scenarios will be published soon.\n        <br /><br />\n        Begin play by having your players choose their characters (or select them randomly) and read the intro text “<a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.X8Sm915HTKFXZejB.JournalEntryPage.YWFvmBOe7eaqFI9w\" data-id=\"YWFvmBOe7eaqFI9w\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">What's the Story Mother?</a>” to them.\n    </p>\n    <br /><br />\n</div>",

The only communications you pick up on are garbled, panicked even.\n        <br /><br />\n        There’s no option but to walk back, and see what the hell is going on...\n    </p>\n    <br /><br />\n</div>",

He keeps buzzing until they answer and then he will beg for help.\n        If they don’t answer, the noise will make any Xenos in their area <b>ACTIVE</b>. <br />\n\n        Osterman has locked the door, but something is trying to get in.\n        In the background they can hear the dull thump, thump, thump of something heavy battering the door to the bar.\n        If they decide to help Wes, there is a Xeno Drone breaking in through the ground floor doors.\n        It’s happy to find other, easier prey. <br />\n        If the PCs wait too long to decide, they hear the door to the bar finally give way, along with the squeals of the Xeno and the screams of Osterman as he is taken away to the hive (+1 <b>STRESS LEVEL</b>).\n        <br /><br />\n        <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">THE BIRTH:</strong> If the PCs have rescued Dr. Komiskey from the Medlab or Maria Hemming from Tannen's Casino, the Chestbursters inside them will be born sooner or later (see <a class=\"content-link\" data-link draggable=\"false\" data-uuid=\"JournalEntry.qljqTQwzeeOjstz8.JournalEntryPage.cMIFcR7JuGn4AgMe\" data-id=\"cMIFcR7JuGn4AgMe\" data-type=\"JournalEntryPage\">THE XENOMORPHS</a>).\n        This is probably the first time the PCs witness such an event, triggering an immediate Panic Roll.\n        <br /><br />\n        <strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">HUNTED:</strong> At no point should the PCs feel safe. If they stay for too long in one place or start to get complacent, one or more <b>ACTIVE</b> Drones or Scouts arrive from the nearby hive and start to stalk them.\n        The only way to survive Hope's Last Day is to use the shuttle to escape\n    </p>\n\n\n\n</div>",

This contains a quick guide to using the Alien RPG system.</p>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"heading\">Alien RPG Core Rules</h2>\n<p>All you need to run a game is imported and organised into folders for each of the asset types. <br /><br />You can rerun the import script at any time by going to Configure Settings&gt; Module Settings and hitting the import button. Any existing assets will not be overwritten so it's useful if you accidentally delete something.</p>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"heading2\">Scenes</h2>\n<p>Organised into three folders:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien RPG Mother Aids: </strong>contains general background images to share with players. <br />The \"ToM - Meeting Room\" scene is designed as a \"Theatre of the Mind\" map to use as a staging area for the players while dealing with the narrative aspects of the scenario. There is an invisible wall across the lower part of the map.<br />The PCs are placed here which allows them to access their character sheets, make rolls etc.<br />The upper portion is for the GM to put NPCs giving the same control.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien RPG Hope's Last Day - Maps </strong>3 scenes for the Scenario.<br />Each scene has light blocking walls and doors and FoW enabled to provide a more immersive experience when the players are moving around the map.<br />There is no lighting on these maps so you may wish to add this.<br />Each map has map pins which will open their respective Journal entry.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien RPG Novgorod Station </strong>3 scenes for Novgorod Station.<br />Each scene has light blocking walls and doors and FoW enabled to provide a more immersive experience when the players are moving around the map.<br />There is no lighting on these maps so you may wish to add this.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"heading2\">Actors</h2>\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien RPG - Actors </strong> has folders for Creatures, Territories and Vehicles which contain all the assets from the Core Rules. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Hope's Last Day - Actors:</strong><br />Folders for PCs and NPCs which are set up as per the scenario with any necessary equipment. The creatures for the scenario are in the Creatures folder under Alien RPG - Actors<br />For PCs and NPCs the Skill-Stunts rolldown (clicking on the spanners next to the skill) will show all the skill stunt options as per the rules.<br />Similarly clicking on the Talent name will show the details for that talent.<br /><br /><br />Where PCs and NPCs have Items these are set to \"Inactive\" so will need to be activated (left mouse click on the item image) by the player/GM to be used.</p>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"heading2\">Items</h2>\n<p>Arranged into 7 folders:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien RPG Armor: </strong>all the armor in the Core Rules.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien RPG Weapons: </strong>all the weapons in the Core Rules.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien RPG Equipment: </strong>all the equipment in the Core Rules.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien RPG Talents(Career): </strong>all the Career Talents in the Core Rules.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien RPG Talents(General): </strong> the General Talents in the Core Rules.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien RPG Systems: </strong> all the Star Systems in the Core Rules.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien RPG Vehicle Weapons: </strong> all the Vehicle Weapons in the Core Rules.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As with the core system just drag and drop the items on to the character sheets as required</p>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"heading2\">Journals</h2>\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien RPG Player Guide</strong> the player rules section journals This can be shared with players. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien RPG GM Guide</strong> the GM rules section journals This should not be shared with players. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien RPG Systems Journals</strong> Journal entries for each of the systems that can be dragged onto the \"Stars of the Middle Heavens\" scene.

Using these images, you can create tiles for use in your games.</p>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"heading\">Recommended Add-on Modules</h2>\n<p>While not necessary to use the Alien system of this module I would recommend installing the following Add-on modules as they make the GM's job a lot easier:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Dice So Nice:</strong> <br />Alien RPG supports 2 dice face types. <br />There is an issue with DsN where the dice do not pick of the correct colour when first used.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">PnP - Pointer and Pings:</strong> <br />Useful for pointing things out to the players and pulling their map focus to where you want it.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Quick Insert - Search Widget:</strong> <br />Allows you to quickly search for assets and drag them directly on to the scene.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"heading\">Macros</h2>\n<p>The Alien system comes with 4 macros that will help you run the game smoothly. <br /><br /></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien - GM Dice Roller:</strong> Allows you to perform ad-hoc dice rolls. Uncheck the GM Only box to make the rolls public.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien - Player Ad-hoc YZE Dice Roller: </strong>Make this available to your players. They need to have a token selected before running the macro.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien - Roll on selected Mother table v10:</strong> provides a drop down listing all the Mother Tables available. Allows multiple rolls against the table and modifiers (+/- x to roll not additional dice).</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien - Roll on selected Creature table v10: </strong>same as above for Creature tables but no modifiers and all rolls are private to the GM.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"
