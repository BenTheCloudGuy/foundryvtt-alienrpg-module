          "value": "STAGE III TRILO­BITE (CARRIER) “CUDDLES”\nFirst hinted at in the garbled recordings of the David Transmissions sent from the USCSS Covenant decades ago, the three-meter tall adult Trilo­bite is a seven-tentacled parasitic extraterrestrial organism. As it matures, H. tabellarium increases size and mass exponentially, growing from a two-kilogram juvenile to a half-ton adult in only one Shift. Just how the creature attains such enormous proportions in so little time has baffled the few scientists who’ve studied them. As the growth process has never been closely monitored, theories range from a bacterial mass propagation on a macroscale to the creature simply being able to feed off ambient radiation.\n\nThe Trilo­bite is a massive delivery system for a Stage IV Deacon embryo. It will use its large, grasping pincer-tipped tentacles to both brace itself and pin its prey, exposing the victim to the toothy maw located on its ventral side. Once so secured, six fleshy petals arranged around the mouth will open, revealing winking orifices that contain coiled prehensile tendrils. These whip-like appendages grasp the head of its prey and hold it steady for oral proboscis insertion. After a successful penetration, H. tabellarium will go catatonic, covering the victim with its own body to protect the host during embryo implantation.\n\nAfter embryo implantation is complete, H. tabellarium will remove itself from the host and die nearby. A Stage IV of the Protomorph life cycle will emerge from the dead host within another 1 Shift.\n\nCONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL: This goddamn thing is huge, and hard to kill.

As it matures, H. tabellarium increases size and mass exponentially, growing from a two-kilogram juvenile to a half-ton adult in only one Shift. Just how the creature attains such enormous proportions in so little time has baffled the few scientists who&rsquo;ve studied them. As the growth process has never been closely monitored, theories range from a bacterial mass propagation on a macroscale to the creature simply being able to feed off ambient radiation. <br /><br />The Trilo&shy;bite is a massive delivery system for a Stage IV Deacon embryo. It will use its large, grasping pincer-tipped tentacles to both brace itself and pin its prey, exposing the victim to the toothy maw located on its ventral side. Once so secured, six fleshy petals arranged around the mouth will open, revealing winking orifices that contain coiled prehensile tendrils. These whip-like appendages grasp the head of its prey and hold it steady for oral proboscis insertion. After a successful penetration, H. tabellarium will go catatonic, covering the victim with its own body to protect the host during embryo implantation. <br /><br />After embryo implantation is complete, H. tabellarium will remove itself from the host and die nearby. A Stage IV of the Protomorph life cycle will emerge from the dead host within another 1 Shift. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> This goddamn thing is huge, and hard to kill.

      "notes": "<div class=\"alienrpg a.entity-link\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">THE LIVING PROTO-HIVE</h1>\n<p>Created when Hessdalen Lights invade a machine&rsquo;s power systems, the biogenetic-material (scientific name Alvumventem erebos) will fuse itself with mechanical forms, leeching power from all systems and altering the machine&rsquo;s molecular structure to accept a self-replicating parasitic growth of proto-plasmamorphic life within it. The infected machinery is altered as the lifeforms take root, growing acidic tendrils and secreting resin that begin to form on the machine&rsquo;s surface. This melding of biology and technology produces the Living Proto-Hive.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">PROTO-HIVE SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong> The special abilities described here are common to the Living Proto-Hive. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">RADIATION: </strong> Most forms of radiation will nourish the Proto-Hive rather than harm it. Any section of Hive bombarded with radiation will regenerate 1 Health per Round for up to ten Rads without ill effects&mdash;i.e., the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls. After that, the overload of radiation takes its toll and damage is suffered as per normal radiation effects (page 76 of the Starter Set rulebook or page 110 of the core rulebook). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">NO HEAT SIGNATURE: </strong> Using infrared and thermographic sensors to locate someone or something within the Living Proto-Hive is impossible&mdash;the entire structure radiates a mask of thermal energy. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">ACID SPLASH: </strong> When a tendril, membrane, wall, vein, or artery of the Proto-Hive is damaged some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within <strong>ENGAGED</strong> range. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash&mdash;hence a fire attack does not have this effect. <br /><br />The strength of an acid splash is the Acid Splash rating of the Hive segment plus the amount of damage that the segment took from the attack, in Base Dice, with Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammo and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring, a ship&rsquo;s hull, and so on (GM&rsquo;s discretion). <br /><br />The acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108 of the core rulebook). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over. <br /><br />If a victim is Broken by the acid splash, or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a <strong>MEDICAL AID</strong> roll. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">IRRITATING SPORES: </strong> These spore polyps grow around sensitive areas of the Living Proto-Hive and act as an early warning system for the Fulfrem&shy;&shy;men. Anyone within <strong>ENGAGED</strong> range of a polyp must make a <strong>MOBILITY</strong> roll (no action) each Round to not disturb it. Failure means the polyp bursts, spreading its spores. They can cause a nasty rash and irritation (+1 <strong>STRESS LEVEL</strong>), but no real damage. The spores can be washed off (and the stress modifier removed with it)&mdash;or the effects can be negated by an anti&shy;allergic from any medkit.<br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> Find the biggest, nastiest biomechanical glob of gunk around&mdash;that will be the infection source. Kill it. Cut out the goddamn thing&rsquo;s heart.</p>\n</div>",

She lost her shit and blew up the plasma tanks. Stykes vented the atmosphere and snuffed the fires. 67 Roughnecks were killed&mdash;not by the explosion, but because Stykes&rsquo; hero-move blew them all into space. He framed Wicks. The company made the station a private prison worksite and made Stykes warden. He requested Wicks spend her life sentence on Erebos so that he could keep an eye on her. Wicks led a prisoner revolt just as Erebos was overrun with Protomorphs. Now, Stykes is more interested in winning his war against Wicks than saving any lives. He has all the station&rsquo;s passcodes memorized. Along with Clerke, Stykes knows about Project Ironfish.</p>\n</div>",

When deployed, they propel themselves about 3 feet off the ground before releasing a mega-voltage electric pulse. The usually non-lethal shock is still strong enough to freeze a person's central nervous system. These weapons are good for crowd control. When there is only one seat left on the last shuttle to leave a space station stuck in a decaying orbit around a gas giant, pop a few of these puppies into the mob, cycle that airlock closed, and strap yourself in for the ride home. All humans in the target zone must make a hard Stamina roll (-2, doesn't count as an action) or be stunned for one round.",

At graduation you told your friends you were staying on for your doctorate &mdash; so they had a fake prison barcode tattooed on the back of your neck. You kept it as a permanent reminder of your debaucherous youth. <br /><br />It wasn&rsquo;t long until you became a major player in biotechnology. After your seventh published paper, you landed a swank government contract. Unfortunately, setbacks soon forced them to close your project. You had a minor nervous breakdown. Therapy didn&rsquo;t really help &mdash; in fact it kind of made things worse. <br /><br />Luckily, Weyland-Yutani got you back on your feet with an iron-clad corporate contract. <br /><br />Now you&rsquo;re developing biotech exclusively for them, and you&rsquo;re okay with that.</p>\n</div>",
