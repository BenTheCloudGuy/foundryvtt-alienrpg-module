The newly born Bloodburster takes one Round to sluggishly free itself from its amniotic sack. As soon as it is Free, it flies into a savage rage and attacks any living creature it encounters. After just a few Turns, the Bloodburster enters Stage IV (juvenile Neomorph).\n\nSprint: As a slow action, the Bloodburster can spring as if having used two run actions, i.e. through two zones or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range from a target.\n\nContainment and Termination Protocol: The best bet is to attack a Bloodburster right after birth-before it has sluggishly freed itself from its amniotic sace. Fire or any serious damage done to the creature at this time causes it to run off and hide while it rapidly grows to its juvenile form.",

    "notes": "<p>Once the Motes entere a host's bloodstream, they deliver their microscopic payload and die. The injected Agent AO-3959X.91-15 begins to mutate white blood cells as they circulate throughout the body until they form a cancerous growth that becomes lodged in a vein or arterial wall. This tumor can take root in any bodily area of sufficient mass-such as the lungs, the digestive tract, the esophagus, or even the brain. Forming an amniotic sack, the tumor begins rapidly converting the host's own mutated cells into a larval Bloodburster.</p>\n<p>If lodged in a region of the body with dense musclee or bone and no easy egress, the gestating creature develops dorsal spines to aid in its escape. When the newly formed Bloodburster is ready to be born, it violently removes itself from the host-using its inordinate strength, spines, teeth, and claws to cut and tear through flesh, bone, and sinew. The process causes severe hemorrhaging and massive tissue damage in the host, is always fatal, and results in the birth of a Bloodburster.</p>\n<p>Bloodbursters have a bulbous head with sharp canines, and run about on all fours. These rabid quadrupedal creatures rely on their speed and agility to avoid damage. Emerging about 0.3 meters in length, Bloodbursters continue to grow exponentially, visibly getting larger as they move about. Highly aggressive, they lash out at anything and everything around them. They use their claws, tail, and teeth to savagely maul their victims.</p>\n<p> </p>",
